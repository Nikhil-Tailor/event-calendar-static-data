SUMMARY:Millenium Walk Around Portsmouth
LOCATION:Needs a location
DESCRIPTION:DetailsI though we'd do something that won't involve puddles o
 r mud and will get some fresh salty air into our lungs.\nWe'll start from 
 Portsmouth Harbour rail station\, meeting on the steps as you come out of 
 the station by the bus terminal. Our walk will take us through Gunwharf Qu
 ays out to Old Portsmouth following the Millenium Trail as best we can. A 
 detour around Spice Island and then along the sea defences (depending if t
 hey are open!). If not open a detour past the derelict church and Old Port
 smouth side streets to rejoin the promenade at Clarence Pier (anyone wanti
 ng crispy funfair donuts or candy floss then we can stop!). On down to the
  D-Day Museum along the promenade. Toilet facilities here if needed\, then
  we can turn around and wander back to Gunwharf for lunch somewhere.\nWalk
 ing time approx 2.5 hours allowed and distance around 5 miles (2.5 out and
  2.5 back). Nothing strenuous and no hills or mud (I hope!).\nNumbers rest
 ricted to 16 as this is my first time hosting a walk.\nI hope I've covered
  everything! If you want to play it by ear with me then I'd love to have y
 ou along for a laugh at what I get wrong.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-03-25T

 . Or maybe if you like\, bring your guitar (or whatever instrument)\, get 
 on stage and play yourself. Each performer will get one free drink.\nIf yo
 u want to play\, then all you need to do is turn up on the night and speak
  to Ian. We keep an informal list\, so if you are first then you are welco
 me to play early. But if you turn up late\, then you will generally be on 
 the end of the list after everyone else has had their turn first.\nIt can 
 sometimes get quite busy\, so if you are bringing friends then it is advis
 able to book a table in advance.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-04-25T15:34:14.

SUMMARY:Millenium Way Walk - Gunwharf Quays to D-D Museum
LOCATION:Portsmouth Harbour\, The Hard Interchange\, Portsmouth
DESCRIPTION:This was a walk that was going to take place in March\, but du
 e to bad weather\, I took the decision to postpone it. Hopefully we'll get
  a good day on this walk!\nWe will start from the steps of Portsmouth Harb
 our rail station where you can see views over to Gosport and the Naval Doc
 kyard where the Warrior\, Nelson's Victory and Henry VIII's Mary Rose are 
 all in residence.\nWe'll walk the Millenium trail through Gunwharf Quays\,
  out and around Old Portsmouth and then up onto the Hot Walls (if shut due
  to sea defence work then we'll walk at ground level until we can get onto
  the Walls. The walk then takes us past Clarence Pier (anyone wanting donu
 ts at the fair we'll wait for you!)\, then down along the seafront to our 
 destination\, the D-Day Museum. We can stop here for refreshments - either
  in the Museum or in Southsea Castle. We then head back to Gunwharf. I est
 imate the walk in total being around 2.5 miles each way\, depending on if 
 we cut corners en route.\nDogs are welcome if kept on a lead as this is a 
 busy area.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-04-30T00:00:27.259Z \n https://www.me

SUMMARY:Hayling Billy Trail Stroll (approx 2.5 miles with an additional wa
 lk option)
LOCATION:Hayling Billy Bites\, Hayling Billy Trail\, Hayling Island
DESCRIPTION:A gentle evening stroll starting from the car park on the Hayl
 ing Billy Trail\, which is behind the Esso Garage on Havant Road\, Hayling
  Island (sign posted "Nature Reserve"). Please don't park in the Esso Gara
 ge as there's no access to the car park from here. There's a little road j
 ust past the garage that takes you to the car park on the shoreline.\nWe'l
 l walk south down the trail for approx 45-50 minutes\, see how far we get\
 , then turn around and wander back. If we get back and you all still feel 
 like a bit more of a wander\, we can walk north along the Oyster Beds and 
 up to the signal by the Bridge\, then back to the car park. It all depends
  on how people are feeling after the first circuit. The second loop going 
 north probably won't take more than another 45 minutes.\nDogs are welcome 
 but please keep your owners in check because the trail is accessible for b
 ikers and horseriders too.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-06-12T00:16:22.697Z \

 and Fareham train station is a mile away.\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nI'll be playing
  all genres through the decades from the 60s to the 80s so there'll be som

 po to dance to and not one slow song! Continuous play with no interruption
 s 🙂\nFancy dress (Freestyle) optional but very much encouraged👨‍

 \, Suzie Quattro and Debbie Harry queueing up at the bar for another round
  of Babycham\, Cinzano and lemonade\, a pint of mild and a cheeky bitter s
 nakebite🤣.\nOn that note the bar is much cheaper than the local pubs
 🙂🍺🍸\nA fun night of musical nostalgia taking us all back to the d
 ays of our youth\, remembering our weekly jaunts to nightclubs as we peere
 d through the smokey air watching the "talent" busting their moves on the 
 dancefloor!\nCan't wait to see you all 🕺🪩\nIMPORTANT\nYou will not b
 e allowed in the club until 7:15pm. Give your name to the doorman so he ca
 n check your name against the list and allow you entry.\nOnce inside the v
 enue\, meet upstairs on the mezzanine floor which overlooks the main room.
  There is no bar up there so get your drinks from the main bar as you walk
  in the concert hall on ground level.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-04-13T00:0

  with physical jobs like shifting compost and planting trees.\n📍 We mee
 t at Morrison's supermarket\, Anchorage Road\, Portsmouth\, PO3 5UH at 6:0
 0pm.\n🏃‍♂️ At 6:15pm we'll run\, walk or cycle to do a 30-40 minu
 te task.\n🏃‍♂️ Then we'll head back to where we started by 7:45pm
 \, do some stretches and maybe grab a beverage?\nIt's FREE. It's fun. It's
  fulfilling. And we're a very friendly bunch. 🍇\n—\nBOOK ONTO THE SES
 SION\nTo come to the session click here: https://www.goodgym.org/areas/por

 m website (this includes creating an account with us if you haven’t alre
 ady - it only takes a few mins).\nThe link above takes you to the session 
 listings in your area - if this session doesn’t fit your schedule\, you 
 may find something that does so check it out.\np.s. GoodGym is a charity a
 nd you will be asked whether you’d like to donate when first creating an
  account. The choice is yours and does not affect your ability to attend a
  session.\n—\nFAQ\nNot sure you'll keep up? GoodGym is for everyone (18+
 ). Whether you've never run before\, or are chasing a marathon PB\, you ar
 e 100% welcome. We always have a back-marker so no one gets left behind.\n
 70% of GoodGym members start as non-runners so if you're new to this kind 
 of thing you will be supported by people who are all on the same journey. 
 👍\nWhat do I need to wear? Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure 
 you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our t
 asks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging t
 hings for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need
  to bring anything? Gardening gloves are really useful for a lot of GoodGy
 m tasks. And a head torch too if it’s likely to get dark. Please bring s
 ome if you can but there’s no requirement 🧤💡🧤\nWhat is GoodGym?
  We're a (really lovely) group of people who use our energy to make a diff
 erence in our local community (and in communities across the UK!). We ofte
 n meet on a weeknight\, at least once a week\, for a session to do good an

 th
DESCRIPTION:How Speed Dating Works in Portsmouth\nWhen you arrive at the P
 ortsmouth venue you will be greeted by our friendly professional hosts. On
 ce everyone has arrived and registered we will briefly explain the format 
 of the evening. The ladies will then be asked to make their way to their a
 llocated table. Once the ladies are seated the gentlemen will be asked to 
 proceed to their first date.\nYou will have 4 minutes to chat to each date
 \, once the 4 minutes is over we will ring a bell to indicate the time is 
 up and for the gentlemen to move to their next date. Four minutes is long 
 enough to see if you click with the person you are talking to and whether 
 you would like to see them again and also short enough if you don't.\nAt t
 he end of each date you have a brief few moments to make some notes on the
  person you have just dated. This is something to help jog your memory for
  the post event matching process the next day.\nHalf way through the event
  you will have an interval break so you can nip to the toilet or top up yo
 ur drink.\nOnce all the dates are over you have the opportunity to stay on
  at the venue to mingle freely with others. Please remember to take your d
 ating card home with you to assist you in entering in your ticks and poten
 tial matches.\nPost Event\nNo later than 11am the following morning our ma
 tching system will be unlocked for you to enter your ticks from the previo
 us evening. You have all day to tick as many people as you like from the n
 ight before. We guarantee you will find someone you will want to see again
 \, otherwise we will give you your next Speed Dating event for free!\nIMPO
 RTANT: The number of attendees on MeetUp doesn`t reflect the real situatio
 n as we sell the majority of tickets on other platforms. Please bear this 
 in mind. You can find more information here: https://bit.ly/3dm7Lju\nPleas
 e note that our bookings team work standard UK business hours - if you boo
 k outside of these hours\, your confirmation from Slowdating will be proce
 ssed once the bookings team are in.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-06-12T00:16:

  with physical jobs like shifting compost and planting trees.\n📍 We mee
 t at Morrison's supermarket\, Anchorage Road\, Portsmouth\, PO3 5UH at 6:0

 te task.\n🏃‍♂️ Then we'll head back to where we started by 7:45pm
 \, do some stretches and maybe grab a beverage?\nIt's FREE. It's fun. It's
  fulfilling. And we're a very friendly bunch. 🍇\n—\nBOOK ONTO THE SES
 SION\nTo come to the session click here: https://www.goodgym.org/areas/por

 m website (this includes creating an account with us if you haven’t alre
 ady - it only takes a few mins).\nThe link above takes you to the session 
 listings in your area - if this session doesn’t fit your schedule\, you 
 may find something that does so check it out.\np.s. GoodGym is a charity a
 nd you will be asked whether you’d like to donate when first creating an
  account. The choice is yours and does not affect your ability to attend a
  session.\n—\nFAQ\nNot sure you'll keep up? GoodGym is for everyone (18+
 ). Whether you've never run before\, or are chasing a marathon PB\, you ar
 e 100% welcome. We always have a back-marker so no one gets left behind.\n
 70% of GoodGym members start as non-runners so if you're new to this kind 
 of thing you will be supported by people who are all on the same journey. 
 👍\nWhat do I need to wear? Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure 
 you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our t
 asks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging t
 hings for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need
  to bring anything? Gardening gloves are really useful for a lot of GoodGy
 m tasks. And a head torch too if it’s likely to get dark. Please bring s
 ome if you can but there’s no requirement 🧤💡🧤\nWhat is GoodGym?
  We're a (really lovely) group of people who use our energy to make a diff
 erence in our local community (and in communities across the UK!). We ofte
 n meet on a weeknight\, at least once a week\, for a session to do good an
 d get fit. We'd love you to come and join us. Any questions\, just pop a c
 omment below or send me a message. Find out everything you need to know at

 iful Surrey countryside.\nhttps://www.hindheadgolfclub.co.uk/\n\nAbout the

 ing/?category=Surrey%20Chambers%20Golf%20Society\n\nTestimonials\n“I was
  first attracted to the society some five years ago by the opportunity to 
 play some great golf courses.  It came as a pleasant surprise to find tha
 t the atmosphere was friendly\, with just the right degree of competitive 
 edge and not with an oppressively business-like environment. It is an exce
 llent set-up to entertain customers or just to come along and share the da
 y with like-minded souls” – Roy\, BMS Ltd\n\n“A welcoming\, vibran
 t and well-organised society for golf-loving local business leaders.  We 
 have the good fortune to play at Surrey’s finest heathland golf courses.

  if you know you will be able to attend.\nThe cost is just TBC plus servic
 e (fixed Price) - Last year was just under £16.00\nBYO Alcoholic Drink (N
 o Alcohol Licence). There is a co-op around the corner.\nSpice Cottage spe
 cialises in both classic and special Indian dishes\, providing an intrigui
 ng combination of freshly cooked food to order with spices from the Indian
  subcontinent producing curries from mild to fiery hot!\nWe are visiting o
 n Tuesday to take advantage of the Tuesday banquet menu deal. There will b
 e a choice of 11 dishes on offer ranging from mild to hot for a set price.
  You do not order instead dishes keeps being bought to your table to share
 . Previously poppadom's were included.\nAn added bonus is that they do not

 ask you cancel as soon as you know you will be unable to attend and not le
 ave it to the day of the event. I appreciate genuine emergencies do happen
  and if you do need to cancel within 24 hours of the event please not only
  change your RSVP but message me in order that I can offer your place to s
 omeone else (even if no waiting list) and/or advise the restaurant as to t

 mportant: If you do RSVP as attending please turn up.\nPS: Cancellations o
 n the day can be annoying as many restaurants do not open lunchtime mid we
 ek. I normally confirm numbers the night before\, but too often I have to 
 try and contact the restaurant and on more than one occasion to change/ re
 duce numbers which can be time consuming as well as embarrassing . Remembe
 r I still work.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-03-25T18:36:03.026Z \n https://w

 le who have lost a loved one to cancer. This event is for people aged 18 a

 the Hayling Billy Trail south to Chichester Harbour. If the tide allows we
  will head along the beach to Warblington then return back. It will last a
 pproximately an hour.\nCan anyone take part?\nOur walk is open to any adul
 t who has had a loved one die from cancer. The aim is to give you space to
  meet and talk with others who have experienced a similar loss\, which our
  users tell us they find extremely helpful.\nWe will be limiting the numbe
 r of walkers to 11 people so that we do not have too large a walking group
 . One of our volunteers will be hosting the event to walk and talk alongsi
 de you.\nPlease note that we do not allow guests unless you let us know in
  advance (as we are capping the number of attendees for each walk).\nPets 
 and children are also not able to attend.\nWhat are the timings for the da
 y?\nWalkers will be meeting at 10:00am and starting at 10:15am.\nWe aim to
  complete the walk\, at approximately 11:15am.\nDo I need to be a professi
 onal walker?\nDefinitely not. The event is about being together\, spending
  time with others who have experienced similar things\, and being outdoors
 . It’s not about being fit or racing.\nHow do I get involved?\nTo regist
 er for this event you will need to complete the registration form below:\n
 https://survey.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8cSBSkXKNiQLNfU\nOnce complete
 d you will receive an email confirming your place and with full details fo
 r the walk.\nWe are unable to respond to messages through MeetUp outside o
 f office working hours. If you are having any difficulty with registering 
 for the group\, please email us at hello@thelossfoundation.org rather than
  through MeetUp and we will get back to you as soon as we can.\nPlease not

 pport. They can be reached on 116 123.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-05-12T00:

SUMMARY:Evening Walk - North Hayling (approx 5 miles)
LOCATION:Northney Road\, Northney Road\, Hayling Island
DESCRIPTION:Please join me for a relaxing stroll around North Hayling.\nWe
 'll start from the car park along the Northney Road. Whilst this is usuall
 y a quiet car park\, it is small\, so if busy there's plenty of parking on
  the road (laybys all along it). The meeting point is the car park itself.
 \nOur walk will take us across the fields to St Peter's Church\, then arou
 nd through the farm fields\, on down to the shoreline and a walk along the
  Oyster Beds\, then back along a track behind the Northney Hotel. If we're
  close to time we'll take a slightly shorter route back once at the Appleg
 reen Service Station.\nTime approx 2 - 2.5 hrs walking depending on walker
 s' pace. Note: There will be 2-3 stiles to get over but can't be avoided. 
 Dogs are welcome provided they keep their owners on a lead in certain plac
 es\, particularly when walking along the road and through farmland areas.\

 fect worlds and imperfect ones. And\, above all\, our need to connect: to 
 be loved and to love.\nCost £2 to cover meetup costs.\nEvent Last Updated

SUMMARY:Early July 2024 Portsmouth Guitar Jam
LOCATION:The Barley Mow\, 39 Castle Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:Come and jam with us on the evening of Tuesday 2nd July. We ha
 ve had a cracking last few meetups and this one is going to be no exceptio
 n!\nCelebrate the joy of playing music together with a beer and some fun t
 unes. It doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play can be 
 played by anyone with a basic ability for chords! If you can't play guitar
  but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too - we al
 ways need singers!\nWe'll tune up\, assess standards and then start playin
 g - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a playl
 ist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\nHotel 
 California\nWish You Were Here\nSaw Her Standing There - Beatles\nAfter Mi
 dnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHandbags and Gladrags - Rod St
 ewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Johnny Cash\nInto the Mystic - 
 Van Morrison\nThe Chain - Fleetwood Mac\nThe Man Who Sold the World - Bowi
 e\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is something you want to play then we'll 
 have a crack at that too - we always like to try something new - and sugge
 stions have been as diverse as Dolly Parton (Jolene) and George Michael - 
 and all were a blast! The only warning is that if the song is particularly
  obscure then you may need to lead the singing too!\nWe will be at the Bar
 ley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever yo
 ur standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty mu
 ch anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the 
 tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can\, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bri
 ng tabs up on.\nMost importantly\, bring a couple of songs that you want u
 s to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-07-02T00:00:31.214Z \n https://www.me

SUMMARY:Discuss Circe by Madeline Miller
LOCATION:The Vaults\, Southsea\, 41-47 Albert Road\, Portsmouth
DESCRIPTION:In the house of Helios\, god of the sun and mightiest of the T
 itans\, a daughter is born. Circe is a strange child - not powerful and te
 rrible\, like her father\, nor gorgeous and mercenary like her mother. Sco
 rned and rejected\, Circe grows up in the shadows\, at home in neither the
  world of gods or mortals. But Circe has a dark power of her own: witchcra
 ft. When her gift threatens the gods\, she is banished to the island of Ai
 aia where she hones her occult craft\, casting spells\, gathering strange 
 herbs and taming wild beasts. Yet a woman who stands alone will never be l
 eft in peace for long - and among her island's guests is an unexpected vis
 itor: the mortal Odysseus\, for whom Circe will risk everything.\nEvent La

SUMMARY:Hayling scarecrow trail
LOCATION:british legion \, Legion road\, Hayling island\, Hampshire
DESCRIPTION:We did part of this trail last year and it was a fun few hours
 .\nI think the theme this year is Sci Fi Join me for a walk around this pa
 rt of Hayling to see how many scarecrows we can spot.\nLet’s make the mo
 st of the light evenings.\nPerhaps we can get some chips or something on t
 he seafront.\nI’ll try and plot a circular route once I know the locatio
 n of scarecrows. I’d think possibly a couple of miles walk taking in as 
 many as we can along the way.\nWe can stop for a drink / snack on the seaf
 ront.\nI suggest meeting by British Legion\, there is parking at the back.

 nIts slightly further afield\, in Portsmouth. But the good news is\, it's 
 cheaper.\nTickets cost £16.\nIt's unallocated seating\, so we can buy tic

 5256087\nI haven't been to this venue before\, but I have seen two of the 
 comedians several times. The headliner\, Paul McCaffrey is one of my favou
 rites. He's been on Live At The Apollo. And does a podcast with Sean Walsh
 .\nMore details on the website above.\nIt says there is a limited bar\, bu
 t you can also bring your own drinks.\nLet's meet inside at 7:30\, so we c
 an have a drink and get seated before the show starts at 8pm.\nI'll post d
 etails of what I'm wearing on the day\, so I'm easy to recognise.\nLooking
  forward to a fab evening of fun and laughter 😄\nAny questions\, feel f
 ree to message me.\nAndrea 😊\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-06-01T00:04:08.3

 nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinc

 unconscious memory embodied in the physical likeness of a long-dead lover.
  Others suffer from the same affliction and speculation rises among scient
 ists that the Solaris ocean may be a massive brain that creates incarnate 
 memories\, but its purpose in doing so remains a mystery . . .\nSolaris ra
 ises a question that has been at the heart of human experience and literat
 ure for centuries: can we truly understand the universe around us without 
 first understanding what lies within?\nCost £2 to cover meetup costs\nEve

 s\, it will never be able to cure an unhappy and unbalanced mind.\nDuring

 ontrol of our minds\, helping us to manage life’s stresses and handle ch
 allenges effectively. This helps us be at peace with ourselves and our sur
 roundings\, and find a different kind of happiness – one that is not dep
 endent on having the perfect external circumstances.\nFollowing this talk\

 ailable which you can enquire about through their website. The 225-acre pr
 operty features a golf course\, and on-site facilities including a fully e
 quipped gym\, heated pool\, and spa facilities.\n####\nWhat We'll Cover\n\

 ow meditation can help us to manage life’s stress and daily challenges.\
 nExperience stillness and calm through easy-to-follow guided meditations.\
 nAn opportunity to ask questions\, and share and learn with like-minded fr
 iends.\n\nBooking & Donations\nThere are limited places available for this

 re embracing a sliding scale policy for this event\, guided by the Buddhis
 t principle of generosity and inclusivity. There are suggested donations t

DESCRIPTION:Come and jam with us on the evening of Tuesday 16th July. We h
 ave had a cracking last few meetups and this one is going to be no excepti
 on!\nCelebrate the joy of playing music together with a beer and some fun 
 tunes. It doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play can be
  played by anyone with a basic ability for chords! If you can't play guita
 r but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too - we a
 lways need singers!\nWe'll tune up\, assess standards and then start playi
 ng - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a play
 list and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\nHotel
  California\nWish You Were Here\nSaw Her Standing There - Beatles\nAfter M
 idnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHandbags and Gladrags - Rod S
 tewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Johnny Cash\nInto the Mystic -
  Van Morrison\nThe Chain - Fleetwood Mac\nThe Man Who Sold the World - Bow
 ie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is something you want to play then we'll
  have a crack at that too - we always like to try something new - and sugg
 estions have been as diverse as Dolly Parton (Jolene) and George Michael -
  and all were a blast! The only warning is that if the song is particularl
 y obscure then you may need to lead the singing too!\nWe will be at the Ba
 rley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever y
 our standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty m
 uch anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the
  tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can\, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to br
 ing tabs up on.\nMost importantly\, bring a couple of songs that you want 
 us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-07-16T00:00:43.826Z \n https://www.m

SUMMARY:Discuss Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver
LOCATION:The Vaults\, Southsea\, 41-47 Albert Road\, Portsmouth
DESCRIPTION:Demon Copperhead is a once-in-a-generation novel that breaks a
 nd mends your heart in the way only the best fiction can.\nDemon's story b
 egins with his traumatic birth to a single mother in a single-wide trailer
 \, looking 'like a little blue prizefighter.' For the life ahead of him he
  would need all of that fighting spirit\, along with buckets of charm\, a 
 quick wit\, and some unexpected talents\, legal and otherwise.\nIn the sou
 thern Appalachian Mountains of Virginia\, poverty isn't an idea\, it's as 
 natural as the grass grows. For a generation growing up in this world\, at
  the heart of the modern opioid crisis\, addiction isn't an abstraction\, 
 it's neighbours\, parents\, and friends. 'Family' could mean love\, or rel
 uctant foster care. For Demon\, born on the wrong side of luck\, the affec
 tion and safety he craves is as remote as the ocean he dreams of seeing on
 e day. The wonder is in how far he's willing to travel to try and get ther
 e.\nSuffused with truth\, anger and compassion\, Demon Copperhead is an ep
 ic tale of love\, loss and everything in between.\nCost £2 to cover meetu

SUMMARY:Speed Dating in Portsmouth for 40s & 50s
LOCATION:The Monarch\, 69 Palmerston Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:How Speed Dating Works in Portsmouth\nWhen you arrive at the P
 ortsmouth venue you will be greeted by our friendly professional hosts. On
 ce everyone has arrived and registered we will briefly explain the format 
 of the evening. The ladies will then be asked to make their way to their a
 llocated table. Once the ladies are seated the gentlemen will be asked to 
 proceed to their first date.\nYou will have 4 minutes to chat to each date
 \, once the 4 minutes is over we will ring a bell to indicate the time is 
 up and for the gentlemen to move to their next date. Four minutes is long 
 enough to see if you click with the person you are talking to and whether 
 you would like to see them again and also short enough if you don't.\nAt t
 he end of each date you have a brief few moments to make some notes on the
  person you have just dated. This is something to help jog your memory for
  the post event matching process the next day.\nHalf way through the event
  you will have an interval break so you can nip to the toilet or top up yo
 ur drink.\nOnce all the dates are over you have the opportunity to stay on
  at the venue to mingle freely with others. Please remember to take your d
 ating card home with you to assist you in entering in your ticks and poten
 tial matches.\nPost Event\nNo later than 11am the following morning our ma
 tching system will be unlocked for you to enter your ticks from the previo
 us evening. You have all day to tick as many people as you like from the n
 ight before. We guarantee you will find someone you will want to see again
 \, otherwise we will give you your next Speed Dating event for free!\nIMPO
 RTANT: The number of attendees on MeetUp doesn`t reflect the real situatio
 n as we sell the majority of tickets on other platforms. Please bear this 
 in mind. You can find more information here: https://bit.ly/3dm7Lju\nPleas
 e note that our bookings team work standard UK business hours - if you boo
 k outside of these hours\, your confirmation from Slowdating will be proce
 ssed once the bookings team are in.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-08-08T00:01:

SUMMARY:Aurora Gatherings
LOCATION:Emsworth\, \, Emsworth
DESCRIPTION:Aurora Gatherings are intended to provide safe spaces for expl
 oring our personal awakenings and insights\, thus allowing accelerated gro
 wth to take place.\nVery often one person’s insight as to why their life
  is unfolding as it is\, sparks another to see their life in a new light t
 oo.\nTo help us live in the magic of the moment\, we tend to avoid getting
  absorbed in repeating second-hand knowledge\, such as great books we have
  read or listened to wonderful teachers\, etc.\nNo two meetings unfold in 
 the same way.\nBecause there are no agenda’s\, no set patterns in the me
 etings\, we are giving the highest good full freedom to guide the gatherin
 g whenever we listen to our intuitions to guide our speech.\nYou are not e
 xpected to appear at each meeting because of some obligation. We would rat
 her you go within to feel whether now is the right time to come to a meeti
 ng. This way\, just the right people come for certain dynamics to unfold. 
 Sometimes there are lots of people\, sometimes just two or three.\nIf you 
 would you like to explore participating in authentic conversation in your 
 community\, beyond beliefs\, assumptions and agendas\, please contact: Jea
 nine Hanneman (07769 666 729) for further details.\nThe Aurora Gathering m
 eets in Jeanine's house near Emsworth.\nThe groups is a very friendly and 
 welcoming one.\nRefreshments provided and donations to the Aurora Gatherin
 gs are accepted.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-06-18T00:01:38.566Z \n https://

 t doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play can be played 
 by anyone with a basic ability for chords! We always need someone who can

 Rod Stewart\nHandbags and Gladrags\nFolsom Prison Blues - Johnny Cash\nInt

 he World - Bowie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is something you want to p
 lay then we'll have a crack at that too - we always like to try something 
 new - and suggestions have been as diverse as Dolly Parton (Jolene) and Ge
 orge Michael - and all were a blast!\nThe Dolphin is a nice pub in Old Por
 tsmouth - it serves food and some nice beers. We will be in the upstairs r
 oom.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am di
 stinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\
 nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing 
 HERE.\nIf you can\, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost

SUMMARY:The Late September 2024 Portsmouth Guitar Jam
LOCATION:The Barley Mow\, 39 Castle Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:Come and jam with us on the evening of Tuesday 24th September.
  We have had a cracking last few meetups and this one is going to be no ex
 ception!\nCelebrate the joy of playing music together with a beer and some
  fun tunes. It doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play c
 an be played by anyone with a basic ability for chords! If you can't play 
 guitar but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too -
  we always need singers!\nWe'll tune up\, assess standards and then start 
 playing - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a
  playlist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\n
 Hotel California - Eagles\nWish You Were Here - Pink Floyd\nSaw Her Standi
 ng There - Beatles\nAfter Midnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHa
 ndbags and Gladrags - Rod Stewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Joh
 nny Cash\nInto the Mystic - Van Morrison\nThe Chain - Fleetwood Mac\nThe M
 an Who Sold the World - Bowie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is something 
 you want to play then we'll have a crack at that too - we always like to t
 ry something new - and suggestions have been as diverse as Dolly Parton (J
 olene) and George Michael - and all were a blast! The only warning is that
  if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead the singing
  too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier
  - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - 
 we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guita
 r Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can\, bring 
 a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly\, bring a cou
 ple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-09-24T00:

SUMMARY:Southwick Park D-Day Circular Walk (5 miles)
LOCATION:Golden Lion Pub\, High Street\, Southwick PO17 6EB
DESCRIPTION:A pleasant 5 mile countryside walk around the Southwick Park e
 state near Portsmouth\, where D-Day was planned\, in this special 80th ann
 iversary year.\nMeet up in the (free) public car park\, behind the Golden 
 Lion pub\, where Churchill\, General Eisenhower and Montgomery drank (grap
 efruit juice!)\nBring suitable walking boots and a picnic (as it's a Sunda
 y and the pubs will be busy) and you can have it down by the Old Medieval 
 Priory after the walk\, or there is a Sandwich Tea Room opposite the pub.\
 nEvery year\, Southwick hosts a 'D-Day Revival' with military vehicles and
  re-enactors\, with no modern vehicles permitted into the village. It is a
  charming example of a 'Feudal Village'\, with some pretty thatched cottag
 es\, and still belongs to the 'Squire of Southwick'. Southwick Park still 
 belongs to the MOD and is used for Police Training.\nEvent Last Updated: 2

SUMMARY:GoodGym Portsmouth // Group Session // Do Good & Get Fit
LOCATION:Morrisons\, Anchorage Road\, Portsmouth
DESCRIPTION:PLEASE VISIT THE WEBSITE TO CONFIRM SESSION DETAILS AND LET US
  KNOW YOU PLAN TO ATTEND. THIS IS MANDATORY.\nWant to do something useful 
 with your exercise? GoodGym is no ordinary gym. We're a group of people wh
 o get fit by doing good - helping out local charities and community groups
  with physical jobs like shifting compost and planting trees.\n📍 We mee
 t at Morrison's supermarket\, Anchorage Road\, Portsmouth\, PO3 5UH at 6:0
 0pm.\n🏃‍♂️ At 6:15pm we'll run\, walk or cycle to do a 30-40 minu
 te task.\n🏃‍♂️ Then we'll head back to where we started by 7:45pm
 \, do some stretches and maybe grab a beverage?\nIt's FREE. It's fun. It's
  fulfilling. And we're a very friendly bunch. 🍇\n—\nBOOK ONTO THE SES
 SION\nTo come to the session click here: https://www.goodgym.org/areas/por
 tsmouth/happenings\nYou will need to confirm your attendance on the GoodGy
 m website (this includes creating an account with us if you haven’t alre
 ady - it only takes a few mins).\nThe link above takes you to the session 
 listings in your area - if this session doesn’t fit your schedule\, you 
 may find something that does so check it out.\np.s. GoodGym is a charity a
 nd you will be asked whether you’d like to donate when first creating an
  account. The choice is yours and does not affect your ability to attend a
  session.\n—\nFAQ\nNot sure you'll keep up? GoodGym is for everyone (18+
 ). Whether you've never run before\, or are chasing a marathon PB\, you ar
 e 100% welcome. We always have a back-marker so no one gets left behind.\n
 70% of GoodGym members start as non-runners so if you're new to this kind 
 of thing you will be supported by people who are all on the same journey. 
 👍\nWhat do I need to wear? Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure 
 you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our t
 asks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging t
 hings for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need
  to bring anything? Gardening gloves are really useful for a lot of GoodGy
 m tasks. And a head torch too if it’s likely to get dark. Please bring s
 ome if you can but there’s no requirement 🧤💡🧤\nWhat is GoodGym?
  We're a (really lovely) group of people who use our energy to make a diff
 erence in our local community (and in communities across the UK!). We ofte
 n meet on a weeknight\, at least once a week\, for a session to do good an
 d get fit. We'd love you to come and join us. Any questions\, just pop a c
 omment below or send me a message. Find out everything you need to know at

SUMMARY:Mid August 2024 Portsmouth Guitar Jam
LOCATION:The Barley Mow\, 39 Castle Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:Come and jam with us on the evening of Tuesday 20th August. We
  have had a cracking last few meetups and this one is going to be no excep
 tion!\nCelebrate the joy of playing music together with a beer and some fu
 n tunes. It doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play can 
 be played by anyone with a basic ability for chords! If you can't play gui
 tar but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too - we
  always need singers!\nWe'll tune up\, assess standards and then start pla
 ying - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a pl
 aylist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\nHot
 el California\nWish You Were Here\nSaw Her Standing There - Beatles\nAfter
  Midnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHandbags and Gladrags - Rod
  Stewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Johnny Cash\nInto the Mystic
  - Van Morrison\nThe Chain - Fleetwood Mac\nThe Man Who Sold the World - B
 owie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is something you want to play then we'
 ll have a crack at that too - we always like to try something new - and su
 ggestions have been as diverse as Dolly Parton (Jolene) and George Michael
  - and all were a blast! The only warning is that if the song is particula
 rly obscure then you may need to lead the singing too!\nWe will be at the 
 Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever
  your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty
  much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see t
 he tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can\, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to 
 bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly\, bring a couple of songs that you wan
 t us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-08-20T00:00:31.854Z \n https://www

SUMMARY:Mid September 2024 Portsmouth Guitar Jam
LOCATION:The Barley Mow\, 39 Castle Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:Come and jam with us on the evening of Tuesday 10th September.
  We have had a cracking last few meetups and this one is going to be no ex
 ception!\nCelebrate the joy of playing music together with a beer and some
  fun tunes. It doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play c
 an be played by anyone with a basic ability for chords! If you can't play 
 guitar but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too -
  we always need singers!\nWe'll tune up\, assess standards and then start 
 playing - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a
  playlist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\n
 Hotel California - Eagles\nWish You Were Here - Pink Floyd\nSaw Her Standi
 ng There - Beatles\nAfter Midnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHa
 ndbags and Gladrags - Rod Stewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Joh
 nny Cash\nInto the Mystic - Van Morrison\nThe Chain - Fleetwood Mac\nThe M
 an Who Sold the World - Bowie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is something 
 you want to play then we'll have a crack at that too - we always like to t
 ry something new - and suggestions have been as diverse as Dolly Parton (J
 olene) and George Michael - and all were a blast! The only warning is that
  if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead the singing
  too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier
  - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - 
 we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guita
 r Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can\, bring 
 a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly\, bring a cou
 ple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-09-10T00:

 Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can\, b
 ring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly\, bring 
 a couple of songs that you want to play!\nWe look forward to welcoming you

SUMMARY:Well after a Thai buffet how about general Asian?
LOCATION:Jinsun\, 56 West St\, Fareham PO16 0JN\, Fareham
DESCRIPTION:Start time amended by popular request. Well the previous Thai 
 buffet event went well so I propose an broader Asian cuisine followup. Yes
  there are a few Thai dishes but the emphasis is more on Japanese and Chin
 ese (and the Peking duck plate is excellent). You can start with Chinese d
 im sums or Japanese sushi\, decide on your main dishes then move on to a c
 hoice of desserts. I will book initially for 8 but can increase numbers if
  needed. It is a slightly earlier start as it is very popular. The restaur
 ant is well served by buses (next to bus station) and train services (10 m
 inute walk from station). Car parking is free after 6pm in the Market Quay
  car park just outside. I will arrive at 6:45pm to claim the seating and l
 eave a message as to where we will be. You pay at the entrance (£22.95) p
 lus a drink cost (cobra or asahi beers\, excellent saki\, soft drinks etc)
 \, and there is a water fountain. It closes at 10pm. The staff are mostly 
 from Hong Kong so they know all about excellent buffet meals. Your arrival
  time can even be flexible so not problem if you come a bit late\, that's 
 the beauty of the setup - but we must know you are coming to keep your pla
 ce available! Be careful re driving if you buy the saki... (Best to take t
 he bottle home with you.)\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-11-01T00:00:42.787Z \n

SUMMARY:Solent LSIP Health and Social Care Roundtable
LOCATION:Holiday Inn\, Leigh Road\, Eastleigh\, Hampshire\,  SO50 9PG\, Un
 ited Kingdom
DESCRIPTION:\n\nWorkforce supply challenges nationally and within the Sole
 nt are expected to continue as demand for health and social care services 
 increases. Workforce growth has struggled to keep pace with rising demands
  over the past decade\, due an ageing population and increasingly complex 
 healthcare needs.\n\nDuring our initial findings back in 2023\, the Local 
 Skills Improvement Plan recommended further research into this important s
 ector\, to better understand the local landscape\, future skills gaps and 
 recruitment challenges. LSIPs are an initiative that’s funded by the Dep
 artment for Education (DfE) with the aim of putting employers at the heart
  of the skills agenda.\n\nIf you are a health and social care company or\,
  stakeholder grappling with recruitment shortages\, persistent skills chal
 lenges then we invite you to attend our forthcoming interactive roundtable
  discussion. This is an opportunity to share emerging trends\, key insight
 s and your in-depth knowledge\, to help shape provision and support employ
 er’s needs.\n\nPlease take this opportunity to contribute and benefit to
  the future of your sector!\n\nEvent Details:\nDate: Wednesday 13 Novembe
 r 2024\nTime:  9.30am - 11:30am\nLocation: Eastleigh Holiday Inn - M3 JC

 our event link: \nIf you have any questions or need more information\, pl
 ease contact us at: lsip@hampshirechamber.co.uk.\n\nLocal Skills Improveme

SUMMARY:The Early December 2024 Portsmouth Guitar Jam
LOCATION:The Barley Mow\, 39 Castle Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:Come and jam with us on the evening of Tuesday 3rd December. W
 e have had a cracking last few meetups and this one is going to be no exce
 ption!\nCelebrate the joy of playing music together with a beer and some f
 un tunes. It doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play can
  be played by anyone with a basic ability for chords! If you can't play gu
 itar but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too - w
 e always need singers!\nWe'll tune up\, assess standards and then start pl
 aying - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a p
 laylist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\nHo
 tel California - Eagles\nWish You Were Here - Pink Floyd\nSaw Her Standing
  There - Beatles\nAfter Midnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHand
 bags and Gladrags - Rod Stewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Johnn
 y Cash\nInto the Mystic - Van Morrison\nThe Chain - Fleetwood Mac\nThe Man
  Who Sold the World - Bowie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is something yo
 u want to play then we'll have a crack at that too - we always like to try
  something new - and suggestions have been as diverse as Dolly Parton (Jol
 ene) and George Michael - and all were a blast! The only warning is that i
 f the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead the singing t
 oo!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier -
  so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we
  play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar 
 Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can\, bring a 
 tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly\, bring a coupl
 e of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-12-03T00:00

SUMMARY:Speed Dating in Portsmouth for 30s & 40s
LOCATION:The Monarch\, 69 Palmerston Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:How Speed Dating Works in Portsmouth\nWhen you arrive at the P
 ortsmouth venue you will be greeted by our friendly professional hosts. On
 ce everyone has arrived and registered we will briefly explain the format 
 of the evening. The ladies will then be asked to make their way to their a
 llocated table. Once the ladies are seated the gentlemen will be asked to 
 proceed to their first date.\nYou will have 4 minutes to chat to each date
 \, once the 4 minutes is over we will ring a bell to indicate the time is 
 up and for the gentlemen to move to their next date. Four minutes is long 
 enough to see if you click with the person you are talking to and whether 
 you would like to see them again and also short enough if you don't.\nAt t
 he end of each date you have a brief few moments to make some notes on the
  person you have just dated. This is something to help jog your memory for
  the post event matching process the next day.\nHalf way through the event
  you will have an interval break so you can nip to the toilet or top up yo
 ur drink.\nOnce all the dates are over you have the opportunity to stay on
  at the venue to mingle freely with others. Please remember to take your d
 ating card home with you to assist you in entering in your ticks and poten
 tial matches.\nPost Event\nNo later than 11am the following morning our ma
 tching system will be unlocked for you to enter your ticks from the previo
 us evening. You have all day to tick as many people as you like from the n
 ight before. We guarantee you will find someone you will want to see again
 \, otherwise we will give you your next Speed Dating event for free!\n### 
 Itinerary\n19:00 Registration Starts\n19:30 Speed Dating starts\n20:15 Int
 erval for drinks\, mingling and relaxing!\n20:30 Speed Dating continues\n2
 1:15/21:30 Speed Dating concludes\, followed by optional post-event social
 izing\n*Please note the times for the event interval and finish are approx
 imates and will depend of the number of daters at the event.\nIMPORTANT: T
 he number of attendees on MeetUp doesn`t reflect the real situation as we 
 sell the majority of tickets on other platforms. Please bear this in mind.
  You can find more information here: https://bit.ly/3dm7Lju\nPlease note t

 ion to Redpanda Connect - Christopher Hoult\n8pm onwards: Optional sociali
 sing at the pub\nAs companies grow\, they continue to produce and ingest m
 ore and more data in the form of events\, instrumentation and logs\, but a
 ll too often just collect it in a central data store for analysis after th
 e fact - if at all. Frequently this requires long ETL processes\, combinin
 g disparate data sets for context missing at run-time\, and slow ad-hoc qu
 eries.\nIn this talk\, I will give an introduction to Redpanda Connect - w
 hich promises "fancy stream processing made operationally mundane" - and p
 resent some effective\, configuration-centric techniques to not only impro
 ve your real-time processing efforts\, but to derive more business value f
 rom your data flows.\nYou are welcome to arrive from 6pm when we will have
  pizza and time for socialising with fellow PHPers. The talk will start at
  7pm and usually lasts til around 8pm. After the talk\, we will head over 
 to a local pub - all are welcome to join but no pressure if you want to he
 ad home afterwards instead!\n***\nSponsors:\nSpectrum IT - Spectrum IT Rec

SUMMARY:Rapscallions Open Mic
LOCATION:Rapscallions\, Osborne Road\, Portsmouth
DESCRIPTION:Come and watch the open mic acts with some rum at Rapscallions
 . Or maybe if you like\, bring your guitar (or whatever instrument)\, get 
 on stage and play yourself. Each performer will get one free drink.\nIf yo
 u want to play\, then all you need to do is turn up on the night and speak
  to Ian. We keep an informal list\, so if you are first then you are welco
 me to play early. But if you turn up late\, then you will generally be on 
 the end of the list after everyone else has had their turn first.\nIt can 
 sometimes get quite busy\, so if you are bringing friends then it is advis
 able to book a table in advance.\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-02-27T00:00:46.

 earch into this key sector.\nWith the forthcoming release of our LSIP Cons
 truction deep dive\, Hampshire Chamber of Commerce is hosting an interacti
 ve roundtable focusing on this sector.\n\nTo provide up to date insights\,
  and further outlook within the Construction sector we will be joined by L
 iz Steel\, Customer Engagement Manager for the South East Central Region

 keholders in the industry to take part in the conversation to better under
 stand the local landscape\, future skills gaps\, and employment challenges
 . \nPlease take this opportunity to contribute and benefit to the future

SUMMARY:The Early November 2024 Portsmouth Guitar Jam
LOCATION:The Barley Mow\, 39 Castle Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:Come and jam with us on the evening of Wednesday 6th November.
  We have had a cracking last few meetups and this one is going to be no ex
 ception!\nCelebrate the joy of playing music together with a beer and some
  fun tunes. It doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play c
 an be played by anyone with a basic ability for chords! If you can't play 
 guitar but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too -
  we always need singers!\nWe'll tune up\, assess standards and then start 
 playing - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a
  playlist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\n
 Hotel California - Eagles\nWish You Were Here - Pink Floyd\nSaw Her Standi
 ng There - Beatles\nAfter Midnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHa
 ndbags and Gladrags - Rod Stewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Joh
 nny Cash\nInto the Mystic - Van Morrison\nThe Chain - Fleetwood Mac\nThe M
 an Who Sold the World - Bowie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is something 
 you want to play then we'll have a crack at that too - we always like to t
 ry something new - and suggestions have been as diverse as Dolly Parton (J
 olene) and George Michael - and all were a blast! The only warning is that
  if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead the singing
  too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier
  - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - 
 we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guita
 r Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can\, bring 
 a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly\, bring a cou
 ple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-11-06T00:

SUMMARY:The Mid Feb 2025 Portsmouth Guitar Jam
LOCATION:The Barley Mow\, 39 Castle Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:Come and jam with us on the evening of Tuesday 18th Feb. We ha
 ve had a cracking last few meetups and this one is going to be no exceptio
 n!\nCelebrate the joy of playing music together with a beer and some fun t
 unes. It doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play can be 
 played by anyone with a basic ability for chords! If you can't play guitar
  but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too - we al
 ways need singers!\nWe'll tune up\, assess standards and then start playin
 g - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a playl
 ist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\nHotel 
 California - Eagles\nWish You Were Here - Pink Floyd\nSaw Her Standing The
 re - Beatles\nAfter Midnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHandbags
  and Gladrags - Rod Stewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Johnny Ca
 sh\nCrazy - Gnarls Barkley\nViva La Vida - Coldplay\nThe Chain - Fleetwood
  Mac\nThe Man Who Sold the World - Bowie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is
  something you want to play then we'll have a crack at that too - we alway
 s like to try something new - and suggestions have been as diverse as Doll
 y Parton (Jolene) and George Michael - and all were a blast! The only warn
 ing is that if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead 
 the singing too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more 
 the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly interm
 ediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ult
 imate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you c
 an\, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly\, 
 bring a couple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 202

SUMMARY:Discuss Chocky by John Wyndham
LOCATION:The Vaults\, Southsea\, 41-47 Albert Road\, Portsmouth
DESCRIPTION:Matthew's parents are worried. At eleven\, he's much too old t
 o have an imaginary friend\, yet they find him talking to and arguing with
  a presence that even he admits is not physically there. This presence - C
 hocky - causes Matthew to ask difficult questions and say startling things
 : he speaks of complex mathematics and mocks human progress. Then\, when M
 atthew does something incredible\, it seems there is more than the imagina
 ry about Chocky. Which is when others become interested and ask questions 
 of their own: who is Chocky? And what could it want with an eleven-year-ol
 d boy?\nCost £2 to cover meetup costs\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-12-02T00:

SUMMARY:Why do businesses need a defined Purpose – A Business Leader's g
 uide to Purpose and Intent based leadership
LOCATION:Online\, United Kingdom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by David Joel from Lanson Consultants Ltd\n\nIn toda
 y’s fast-moving and unpredictable world\, businesses face constant chang
 e\, complexity\, and uncertainty. This presentation\, A Director’s Guide
  to Purpose and Intent-Based Leadership by David Joel\, explores how a cle
 arly defined purpose helps organisations navigate this environment with cl
 arity and confidence. A strong purpose aligns leadership\, shapes culture\
 , and drives strategic decision-making. Directors are jointly responsible 
 for setting this purpose\, along with the organisation’s vision and valu
 es. They must lead with entrepreneurial spirit\, ensuring the right balanc
 e between ambition and effective governance. The Leaders role is to create
  a shared purpose  to drive and enable people across the organisation. Fr
 eeing them to act with intent\, agility\, and responsibility.\n\n\n\nPurpo
 se-led leadership requires more than top-down control—it calls for trust
 \, visibility\, and authentic communication. Inspired by L. David Marquet
 ’s intent-based leadership model\, this guide reframes leadership as a p
 ractice rooted in purpose rather than personality. High-performing teams a
 re built on clarity\, shared goals\, and mutual respect. Leaders must know
  when to take the reins and when to step back\, giving others the space an
 d authority to lead. When purpose is embedded across the organisation\, pe
 ople feel proud\, valued\, and accountable—not just for outcomes\, but f
 or the greater mission. This is leadership that not only drives performanc
 e but fosters a culture of ownership\, adaptability\, and sustained succes
 s.\n\nThis is an online session. The link to this will be sent out to thos
 e with confirmed bookings ahead of time.\n\nClick here to view David's Lin

SUMMARY:Speed Dating in Portsmouth for 40s & 50s
LOCATION:Monarch\, 69 Palmerston Rd\, Southsea \, PO5 3PP\, Portsmouth
DESCRIPTION:How Speed Dating Works in Portsmouth\nWhen you arrive at the P
 ortsmouth venue you will be greeted by our friendly professional hosts. On
 ce everyone has arrived and registered we will briefly explain the format 
 of the evening. The ladies will then be asked to make their way to their a
 llocated table. Once the ladies are seated the gentlemen will be asked to 
 proceed to their first date.\nYou will have 4 minutes to chat to each date
 \, once the 4 minutes is over we will ring a bell to indicate the time is 
 up and for the gentlemen to move to their next date. Four minutes is long 
 enough to see if you click with the person you are talking to and whether 
 you would like to see them again and also short enough if you don't.\nAt t
 he end of each date you have a brief few moments to make some notes on the
  person you have just dated. This is something to help jog your memory for
  the post event matching process the next day.\nHalf way through the event
  you will have an interval break so you can nip to the toilet or top up yo
 ur drink.\nOnce all the dates are over you have the opportunity to stay on
  at the venue to mingle freely with others. Please remember to take your d
 ating card home with you to assist you in entering in your ticks and poten
 tial matches.\nPost Event\nNo later than 11am the following morning our ma
 tching system will be unlocked for you to enter your ticks from the previo
 us evening. You have all day to tick as many people as you like from the n
 ight before. We guarantee you will find someone you will want to see again
 \, otherwise we will give you your next Speed Dating event for free!\n### 
 Itinerary\n19:00 Registration Starts\n19:30 Speed Dating starts\n20:15 Int
 erval for drinks\, mingling and relaxing!\n20:30 Speed Dating continues\n2
 1:15/21:30 Speed Dating concludes\, followed by optional post-event social
 izing\n*Please note the times for the event interval and finish are approx
 imates and will depend of the number of daters at the event.\nIMPORTANT: T
 he number of attendees on MeetUp doesn`t reflect the real situation as we

SUMMARY:The Mid March 2025 Portsmouth Guitar Jam
LOCATION:The Barley Mow\, 39 Castle Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:Come and jam with us on the evening of Tuesday 18th March. We 
 have had a cracking last few meetups and this one is going to be no except
 ion!\nCelebrate the joy of playing music together with a beer and some fun
  tunes. It doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play can b
 e played by anyone with a basic ability for chords! If you can't play guit
 ar but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too - we 
 always need singers!\nWe'll tune up\, assess standards and then start play
 ing - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a pla
 ylist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\nHote
 l California - Eagles\nWish You Were Here - Pink Floyd\nSaw Her Standing T
 here - Beatles\nAfter Midnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHandba
 gs and Gladrags - Rod Stewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Johnny 
 Cash\nCrazy - Gnarls Barkley\nViva La Vida - Coldplay\nThe Chain - Fleetwo
 od Mac\nThe Man Who Sold the World - Bowie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there 
 is something you want to play then we'll have a crack at that too - we alw
 ays like to try something new - and suggestions have been as diverse as Do
 lly Parton (Jolene) and George Michael - and all were a blast! The only wa
 rning is that if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lea
 d the singing too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe mor
 e the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly inte
 rmediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use U
 ltimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you
  can\, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly\
 , bring a couple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2

SUMMARY:Preparing to comply with EU and global sustainability regulation
LOCATION:United Kingdom
DESCRIPTION:Preparing to comply with EU and global sustainability regulati
 on\n\nGlobal regulation need not always be a stressful burden\, it can pre
 sent significant opportunities for differentiation\, diversification\, and
  expansion. Small businesses have the benefit of agility over their corpor
 ate counterparts\, however when they encounter regulation for which they a
 re ill-prepared\, they are prone to making knee jerk reactions\, expensive
  mistakes\, and incurring unnecessary expense trying to comply last minute
  e.g. recent panic due to EU General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR).\n\n
 \n\nSustainability regulation at both the EU and global level is already i
 mpacting small UK businesses in terms of carbon reporting and recycling le
 vies\, however\, regulation is only set to increase in scope and reach\, i
 t is not going away. Whilst the EU spearheads much regulation\; with the e
 stablishment of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in
  2023\, countries such as Australia\, Canada\, Japan\, Singapore\, and an 
 increasing number of US states are now establishing their own local legisl
 ation to comply with ISSB standards.\n\nBy understanding what regulation i
 s to be introduced and when\, it is possible to cost-effectively plan\, an
 d take pragmatic\, manageable steps towards compliance so that you can exp
 loit global trade opportunities. Sustainability regulation will dramatical
 ly alter the way we trade globally\; those companies willing to work towar
 ds compliance seek to gain market share from those inevitably forced to wi
 thdraw due to inability to comply.\n\nJoin Hampshire Chamber of Commerce f
 or this one-hour webinar to gain insight into the global sustainability re
 gulatory landscape\, including an overview of the new EU Product Packaging
  Waste Regulation (PPWR) coming into force this year and imposing new obli
 gations on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Importantly\, this webi
 nar will share practical advice on what you can do to work towards complia
 nce and future-proofing your global trade.\n\nAbout our speaker:\n\nAndrea
  Collins\nMIEx\, MBA\, BA (Hons)\n\n\n\nAndrea is an international trade s
 pecialist with 25+ years’ experience in the industry. A linguist fluent 
 in French and Spanish\, Andrea specializes in importing\, exporting\, glob

DESCRIPTION:Let's meet up at Port Solent for a browse around the market st
 alls on the boardwalk and then go for a bite to eat afterwards. The Wether
 spoons pub\, Sir Alec Rose\, has a menu which should suit everyone. It als
 o has great views of the marina.\nHeld on the second Sunday of the month f
 rom April until November 2025\, Port Solent's Waterside Market is home to 
 over 50 stalls.\nPort Solent's Sunday Waterside Markets are a must-visit. 
 The market offers a diverse range of goods and services\, from fresh produ
 ce and artisanal food products to handmade crafts and gifts. With so much 
 to choose from and a variety of food and drink vendors on site\, it's the 
 perfect way to spend a relaxing Sunday.\nSeveral of the shops in Port Sole
 nt will also be open\, such as Klass\, Pavers shoes & Cotton Traders.\nWhe
 ther you're looking to shop for unique items or just enjoy the atmosphere\
 , the Sunday Waterside Markets are not to be missed.\nParking free at Port
  Solent but it's probably a good idea to get there early as it can get qui
 te busy. Sometimes there is a classic car display in part of the car park 
 as well and that can take up quite a lot of the parking spaces.\nPlease re
 move your name from the 'attending' list if you change your mind about com
 ing along - thanks!\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-04-11T23:50:43.494Z \n https

 lever use of interactives and video provide for fascinating insight into t
 he history of British Army flying.\n\nThe Museum underwent a major transfo
 rmation in 2019 featuring new displays\, interactives and AV shows to enga
 ge visitors of all ages. The refurbishment also saw the completion of a di
 gnified memorial to more than 5\,000 that have died in the service of Brit
 ish Army flying from early pioneers to the modern Army Air Corps.\n\nLouis

SUMMARY:The Mid April 2025 Portsmouth Guitar Jam
LOCATION:The Barley Mow\, 39 Castle Road\, Southsea
DESCRIPTION:Come and jam with us on the evening of Tuesday 15th April. We 
 have had a cracking last few meetups and this one is going to be no except
 ion!\nCelebrate the joy of playing music together with a beer and some fun
  tunes. It doesn't matter what standard you are - everything we play can b
 e played by anyone with a basic ability for chords! If you can't play guit
 ar but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too - we 
 always need singers!\nWe'll tune up\, assess standards and then start play
 ing - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a pla
 ylist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\nHote
 l California - Eagles\nWish You Were Here - Pink Floyd\nSaw Her Standing T
 here - Beatles\nAfter Midnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHandba
 gs and Gladrags - Rod Stewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Johnny 
 Cash\nCrazy - Gnarls Barkley\nViva La Vida - Coldplay\nThe Chain - Fleetwo
 od Mac\nThe Man Who Sold the World - Bowie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there 
 is something you want to play then we'll have a crack at that too - we alw
 ays like to try something new - and suggestions have been as diverse as Do
 lly Parton (Jolene) and George Michael - and all were a blast! The only wa
 rning is that if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lea
 d the singing too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe mor
 e the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly inte
 rmediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use U
 ltimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you
  can\, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly\
 , bring a couple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2

LOCATION:The Spring Arts & Heritage Centre\, 56 East Street\, Havant
DESCRIPTION:On Sunday 20th April 2025 we will be hosting an informal walk

 24%2C768&ssl=1)\nWho is this walk for?\nThis walk is for adults (18+) who 
 have lost a loved one to cancer. It’s a space to connect with others who
  truly understand\, in a supportive and relaxed environment.\nWhere will w
 e be walking?\nWe’ll begin in Havant and follow the scenic Hayling Billy
  Trail down to Chichester Harbour. If the tide allows\, we’ll stroll alo
 ng the beach to Warblington before heading back. The walk will take about 
 an hour and is designed to be gentle and enjoyable.\nFeeling nervous?\nWe 
 understand that joining a group like this might feel daunting – it’s c
 ompletely normal to feel unsure. Many of our walkers have felt the same wa
 y at first. Rest assured\, this is a welcoming and supportive space. You c
 an take things at your own pace\, and there’s no pressure to talk more t
 han you feel comfortable. Here is a quote from one of our previous walkers
 :\n“It was a small enough group that we could engage in deeper conversat
 ion. We all went for coffee afterwards. Honestly\, the best grief event I
 ’ve ever attended. Thank you Loss Foundation!!”\nWhat to expect:\n\nA 
 small group of up to 10 walkers to keep things intimate and comfortable.\n
 A friendly volunteer host who will walk and chat with you\, making sure ev
 eryone feels at ease.\nThe chance to spend time outdoors with people who
 ’ve experienced similar loss.\n\nWe ask that you let us know in advance 
 if you’d like to bring a guest (as spaces are limited) and kindly note t
 hat pets and children cannot join the walk.\nWhat are the timings for the 
 day?\nWalkers will be meeting at 10:00am. We aim to complete the walk just
  over one hour later\, at approximately 11:15am.\nWho is the host?\nOur lo
 vely volunteer Steve will be hosting this walk. Look out for his friendly 
 face on arrival.\n![img](https://i0.wp.com/thelossfoundation.org/wp-conten
 t/uploads/2024/09/IMG_20241008_170110.jpg?resize=200%2C300&ssl=1)\nDo I ne
 ed to be an experienced walker?\nNot at all! This walk isn’t about fitne
 ss or speed. It’s about being outdoors\, meeting others\, and finding co
 mfort in shared experiences. Whether you’re a seasoned walker or a total
  beginner\, you’re very welcome.\nReady to join us?\nSign up by completi
 ng the registration form below\, and we’ll send you an email with all th
 e details you need to take part.\nhttps://survey.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form

 our place and with full details for the walk.\nWe are unable to respond to
  messages through MeetUp outside of office working hours. If you are havin
 g any difficulty with registering for the group\, please email us at hello

DESCRIPTION:The Hampshire Sustainable Action Network (HSAN) is a practical
  support network for small and medium-sized businesses across the county w
 ho want to make progress on sustainability in a way that fits with their d
 ay-to-day operations.\n\nWe know that for many businesses\, sustainability
  can feel like a stretch – something that’s hard to prioritise when ti
 me\, money and capacity are already tight. HSAN is here to make it easier\
 , more achievable\, and more relevant.\n\nThe network runs bimonthly event
 s and supports a growing peer group of business leaders who are working to
 wards more sustainable ways of operating. These sessions are designed to b
 e useful and straightforward. Each one includes structured networking\, a 
 tour of a host business\, a practical talk from an expert\, and space for 
 discussion and problem-solving. Between events\, members stay connected th
 rough updates\, shared resources and informal support.\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes
  HSAN different is its tone. There’s no jargon\, no pressure to be perfe
 ct\, and no push towards any one accreditation or scheme. Businesses are e
 ncouraged to identify three realistic priorities\, things they can do\, an
 d share their progress with the group. This helps others learn\, builds co
 nfidence\, and keeps the focus on what’s achievable.\n\nThe network is o
 pen to businesses at any stage. Whether you’re just starting out or alre
 ady making changes\, HSAN offers a space to learn from others\, ask questi
 ons\, and find support. It’s not about ticking boxes – it’s about ma
 king steady progress and celebrating what works.\n\nMembers are also encou
 raged to bring their challenges to the group. Whether it’s a technical i
 ssue\, a communications question\, or something sector-specific\, the idea
  is to find better solutions together. The network is designed to be flexi
 ble\, responsive and shaped by its members.\n\nIf you’re looking for a n
 o-nonsense way to explore sustainability\, HSAN offers the structure\, spa
 ce and peer support to help you get started – and keep going.\n\nIf you 
 have an accessibility requirement\, please let us know by using the 'Speci

 ements\, this 45-minute workshop offers business leaders\, entrepreneurs\,
  and professionals a practical\, jargon-free guide to evaluating the finan
 cial health of a business.\n\n\n\n\nUsing real-life case studies and inter
 active exercises\, the session brings finance to life in plain English—n
 o complicated maths or accountancy expertise required. Staying true to the
  core message that "finance is not about the maths\, it's about the story\
 ," the workshop introduces a structured approach to understanding business
  viability through asking the right questions and making observation as ke
 y health indicators.\n\nParticipants will leave with a simple but powerful
  checklist for assessing financial health—whether in their own business 
 or others—boosting their confidence in financial discussions and decisio
 n-making. With clear explanations of performance measures and how to apply
  them\, the session enables attendees to take greater control of business 
 outcomes. It encourages the participants to see beyond the numbers  to th
 e story they tell and hence make better business decisions.\n\nClick here

SUMMARY:Driving the business forward – A Business Leader's guide to lead

LOCATION:Online\, United Kingdom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by David Joel from Lanson Consultants Ltd\n\nIn this
  highly interactive\, 45-minute session\, David Joel offers business leade
 rs a practical\, thought-provoking guide to effective leadership at board 
 level. The session begins by unpacking the fundamental responsibilities of
  a board—setting vision\, purpose\, and values\, providing entrepreneuri
 al leadership\, and maintaining effective oversight in a VUCA (Volatile\, 
 Uncertain\, Complex\, Ambiguous) world. David highlights the unique pressu
 res directors face\, including the need to ensure adequate resources\, eva

  governance and vision with control – and illustrates how great boards n
 avigate these tensions by embracing learning\, adaptability\, and clear st
 rategic focus.\n\n\n\nThe session takes a deeper dive into what makes a hi
 gh-performing leadership team\, inviting participants to reflect on the ch
 aracteristics of good leaders and the importance of collaboration. Through
  lively discussion and interactive chat exercises\, David explores the ana
 tomy of successful boards: clarity of purpose\, discipline\, balance\, ext
 ernal awareness\, and a strong “tone from the top.” He also examines h
 ow values\, behaviour\, and strategic decisions must align to shape organi
 sational culture. With insights from leadership expert Simon Sinek and a c
 losing reflection on how directors can drive sustainable progress\, this s
 ession leaves attendees better equipped to lead with purpose\, authenticit
 y and impact.\n\nThis is an online session. The link to this will be sent 
 out to those with confirmed bookings ahead of time.\n\nClick here to view
