Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our tasks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging things for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need to bring anything?

Once everyone has arrived and registered we will briefly explain the format of the evening. The ladies will then be asked to make their way to their allocated table. Once the ladies are seated the gentlemen will be asked to proceed to their first date.\nYou will have 4 minutes to chat to each date, once the 4 minutes is over we will ring a bell to indicate the time is up and for the gentlemen to move to their next date. Four minutes is long enough to see if you click with the person you are talking to and whether you would like to see them again and also short enough if you don't.\nAt the end of each date you have a brief few moments to make some notes on the person you have just dated. This is something to help jog your memory for the post event matching process the next day.\nHalf way through the event you will have an interval break so you can nip to the toilet or top up your drink.\nOnce all the dates are over you have the opportunity to stay on at the venue to mingle freely with others. Please remember to take your dating card home with you to assist you in entering in your ticks and potential matches.\nPost Event\nNo later than 11am the following morning our matching system will be unlocked for you to enter your ticks from the previous evening. You have all day to tick as many people as you like from the night before. We guarantee you will find someone you will want to see again, otherwise we will give you your next Speed Dating event for free!\nIMPORTANT: The number of attendees on MeetUp doesn`t reflect the real situation as we sell the majority of tickets on other platforms.

THIS IS MANDATORY.\nWant to do something useful with your exercise? GoodGym is no ordinary gym. We're a group of people who get fit by doing good - helping out local charities and community groups with physical jobs like shifting compost and planting trees.\n📍 We meet at Morrison's supermarket, Anchorage Road, Portsmouth, PO3 5UH at 6:00pm.\n🏃‍♂️ At 6:15pm we'll run, walk or cycle to do a 30-40 minute task.\n🏃‍♂️ Then we'll head back to where we started by 7:45pm, do some stretches and maybe grab a beverage?\nIt's FREE. It's fun. It's fulfilling. And we're a very friendly bunch. 🍇\n—\nBOOK ONTO THE SESSION\nTo come to the session click here: https://www.goodgym.org/areas/portsmouth/happenings\nYou will need to confirm your attendance on the GoodGym website (this includes creating an account with us if you haven’t already - it only takes a few mins).\nThe link above takes you to the session listings in your area - if this session doesn’t fit your schedule, you may find something that does so check it out.\np.s. GoodGym is a charity and you will be asked whether you’d like to donate when first creating an account. The choice is yours and does not affect your ability to attend a session.\n—\nFAQ\nNot sure you'll keep up? GoodGym is for everyone (18+). Whether you've never run before, or are chasing a marathon PB, you are 100% welcome. We always have a back-marker so no one gets left behind.\n70% of GoodGym members start as non-runners so if you're new to this kind of thing you will be supported by people who are all on the same journey. 👍\nWhat do I need to wear? Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our tasks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging things for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need to bring anything? Gardening gloves are really useful for a lot of GoodGym tasks. And a head torch too if it’s likely to get dark. Please bring some if you can but there’s no requirement 🧤💡🧤\nWhat is GoodGym? We're a (really lovely) group of people who use our energy to make a difference in our local community (and in communities across the UK!). We often meet on a weeknight, at least once a week, for a session to do good and get fit. We'd love you to come and join us. Any questions, just pop a comment below or send me a message.

This event is for people aged 18 and over.\nWhere are we walking?\nThe walk will start in Havant and follow the Hayling Billy Trail south to Chichester Harbour. If the tide allows we will head along the beach to Warblington then return back. It will last approximately an hour.\nCan anyone take part?\nOur walk is open to any adult who has had a loved one die from cancer. The aim is to give you space to meet and talk with others who have experienced a similar loss, which our users tell us they find extremely helpful.\nWe will be limiting the number of walkers to 11 people so that we do not have too large a walking group. One of our volunteers will be hosting the event to walk and talk alongside you.\nPlease note that we do not allow guests unless you let us know in advance (as we are capping the number of attendees for each walk).\nPets and children are also not able to attend.\nWhat are the timings for the day?\nWalkers will be meeting at 10:00am and starting at 10:15am.\nWe aim to complete the walk, at approximately 11:15am.\nDo I need to be a professional walker?\nDefinitely not. The event is about being together, spending time with others who have experienced similar things, and being outdoors. It’s not about being fit or racing.\nHow do I get involved?\nTo register for this event you will need to complete the registration form below:\nhttps://survey.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8cSBSkXKNiQLNfU\nOnce completed you will receive an email confirming your place and with full details for the walk.\nWe are unable to respond to messages through MeetUp outside of office working hours. If you are having any difficulty with registering for the group, please email us at hello@thelossfoundation.org rather than through MeetUp and we will get back to you as soon as we can.\nPlease note that we are not a crisis service, so if you are in need of immediate support please do reach out to Samaritans who provide immediate listening support.

Whether you've never run before, or are chasing a marathon PB, you are 100% welcome. We always have a back-marker so no one gets left behind.\n70% of GoodGym members start as non-runners so if you're new to this kind of thing you will be supported by people who are all on the same journey. 👍\nWhat do I need to wear? Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our tasks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging things for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need to bring anything? Gardening gloves are really useful for a lot of GoodGym tasks. And a head torch too if it’s likely to get dark. Please bring some if you can but there’s no requirement 🧤💡🧤\nWhat is GoodGym? We're a (really lovely) group of people who use our energy to make a difference in our local community (and in communities across the UK!).

Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our tasks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging things for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need to bring anything?

THIS IS MANDATORY.\nWant to do something useful with your exercise? GoodGym is no ordinary gym. We're a group of people who get fit by doing good - helping out local charities and community groups with physical jobs like shifting compost and planting trees.\n📍 We meet at Morrison's supermarket, Anchorage Road, Portsmouth, PO3 5UH at 6:00pm.\n🏃‍♂️ At 6:15pm we'll run, walk or cycle to do a 30-40 minute task.\n🏃‍♂️ Then we'll head back to where we started by 7:45pm, do some stretches and maybe grab a beverage?\nIt's FREE. It's fun. It's fulfilling. And we're a very friendly bunch. 🍇\n—\nBOOK ONTO THE SESSION\nTo come to the session click here: https://www.goodgym.org/areas/portsmouth/happenings\nYou will need to confirm your attendance on the GoodGym website (this includes creating an account with us if you haven’t already - it only takes a few mins).\nThe link above takes you to the session listings in your area - if this session doesn’t fit your schedule, you may find something that does so check it out.\np.s. GoodGym is a charity and you will be asked whether you’d like to donate when first creating an account. The choice is yours and does not affect your ability to attend a session.\n—\nFAQ\nNot sure you'll keep up? GoodGym is for everyone (18+). Whether you've never run before, or are chasing a marathon PB, you are 100% welcome. We always have a back-marker so no one gets left behind.\n70% of GoodGym members start as non-runners so if you're new to this kind of thing you will be supported by people who are all on the same journey. 👍\nWhat do I need to wear? Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our tasks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging things for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need to bring anything? Gardening gloves are really useful for a lot of GoodGym tasks. And a head torch too if it’s likely to get dark. Please bring some if you can but there’s no requirement 🧤💡🧤\nWhat is GoodGym? We're a (really lovely) group of people who use our energy to make a difference in our local community (and in communities across the UK!). We often meet on a weeknight, at least once a week, for a session to do good and get fit. We'd love you to come and join us. Any questions, just pop a comment below or send me a message.

We jump from one desire to the next, one job, partner, home, car to the next, but find we’re still unsatisfied. While modern science and material development can alleviate physical ailments, it will never be able to cure an unhappy and unbalanced mind.\nDuring this evening talk, held at Meon Valley Hotel in Southampton, we will explore a different approach – simple yet effective techniques from the Buddhist tradition for finding calm, focus, and a sense of wellbeing amidst everyday challenges and change.\nWith time and practice, we can regain control of our minds, helping us to manage life’s stresses and handle challenges effectively. This helps us be at peace with ourselves and our surroundings, and find a different kind of happiness – one that is not dependent on having the perfect external circumstances.\nFollowing this talk, on Saturday, 29th June, we will be hosting a day retreat called ‘Transforming Your Mind: An Introduction to Buddhist Mind Training‘ which offers us a chance to explore in more depth, We’d be delighted to see you for both events to make the most of this time together.\nIf you require accommodation, the Meon Valley Hotel & Country Club has overnight rooms available which you can enquire about through their website. The 225-acre property features a golf course, and on-site facilities including a fully equipped gym, heated pool, and spa facilities.\n####\nWhat We'll Cover\n\nExplore meditation techniques for relaxation and stress release.\nLearn how meditation can help us to manage life’s stress and daily challenges.\nExperience stillness and calm through easy-to-follow guided meditations.\nAn opportunity to ask questions, and share and learn with like-minded friends.\n\nBooking & Donations\nThere are limited places available for this evening talk. Please book in advance using the form on our website.\nWe are embracing a sliding scale policy for this event, guided by the Buddhist principle of generosity and inclusivity. There are suggested donations to help cover the cost of putting on this talk and the following day retreat, including room hires, lunch, teas & coffees, and the travel and accommodation cost for the teacher and volunteers.\nChoosing the higher option includes a donation to support our activities for the benefit of all.\nOption 1 - Cover Our Running Costs + Donation - £15\nOption 2 - Cover Our Running Costs - £10\nOption 3 - Low Waged - £6\nOption 4 - Donation of Your Choosing\nWe firmly believe, however, that financial constraints should never be a barrier to participation. If the suggested amount is beyond your means, please choose the lower option or contribute what you can — every offering helps make this event possible for the collective good.

For the life ahead of him he would need all of that fighting spirit, along with buckets of charm, a quick wit, and some unexpected talents, legal and otherwise.\nIn the southern Appalachian Mountains of Virginia, poverty isn't an idea, it's as natural as the grass grows. For a generation growing up in this world, at the heart of the modern opioid crisis, addiction isn't an abstraction, it's neighbours, parents, and friends. 'Family' could mean love, or reluctant foster care. For Demon, born on the wrong side of luck, the affection and safety he craves is as remote as the ocean he dreams of seeing one day. The wonder is in how far he's willing to travel to try and get there.\nSuffused with truth, anger and compassion, Demon Copperhead is an epic tale of love, loss and everything in between.\nCost £2 to cover meetup costs\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-09-02T00:00:35.522Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/southseabookclub/events/298997056/?recId=272f735b-3f6d-44bd-8666-e64df15207ec&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby&searchId=d6f8ef89-cd95-4af5-b741-4a6a1761d888&eventOrigin=find_page$inPerson","location":"The Vaults, Southsea, 41-47 Albert Road, Portsmouth","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":22548,"startDate":"2024-08-30T09:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-08-30T12:00:00.000Z","summary":"North Hayling Walk - approx 4.5 miles","description":"Please join me on a walk around North Hayling.

Once everyone has arrived and registered we will briefly explain the format of the evening. The ladies will then be asked to make their way to their allocated table. Once the ladies are seated the gentlemen will be asked to proceed to their first date.\nYou will have 4 minutes to chat to each date, once the 4 minutes is over we will ring a bell to indicate the time is up and for the gentlemen to move to their next date. Four minutes is long enough to see if you click with the person you are talking to and whether you would like to see them again and also short enough if you don't.\nAt the end of each date you have a brief few moments to make some notes on the person you have just dated. This is something to help jog your memory for the post event matching process the next day.\nHalf way through the event you will have an interval break so you can nip to the toilet or top up your drink.\nOnce all the dates are over you have the opportunity to stay on at the venue to mingle freely with others. Please remember to take your dating card home with you to assist you in entering in your ticks and potential matches.\nPost Event\nNo later than 11am the following morning our matching system will be unlocked for you to enter your ticks from the previous evening. You have all day to tick as many people as you like from the night before. We guarantee you will find someone you will want to see again, otherwise we will give you your next Speed Dating event for free!\nIMPORTANT: The number of attendees on MeetUp doesn`t reflect the real situation as we sell the majority of tickets on other platforms.

It's fun. It's fulfilling. And we're a very friendly bunch. 🍇\n—\nBOOK ONTO THE SESSION\nTo come to the session click here: https://www.goodgym.org/areas/portsmouth/happenings\nYou will need to confirm your attendance on the GoodGym website (this includes creating an account with us if you haven’t already - it only takes a few mins).\nThe link above takes you to the session listings in your area - if this session doesn’t fit your schedule, you may find something that does so check it out.\np.s. GoodGym is a charity and you will be asked whether you’d like to donate when first creating an account. The choice is yours and does not affect your ability to attend a session.\n—\nFAQ\nNot sure you'll keep up? GoodGym is for everyone (18+). Whether you've never run before, or are chasing a marathon PB, you are 100% welcome. We always have a back-marker so no one gets left behind.\n70% of GoodGym members start as non-runners so if you're new to this kind of thing you will be supported by people who are all on the same journey. 👍\nWhat do I need to wear? Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our tasks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging things for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need to bring anything? Gardening gloves are really useful for a lot of GoodGym tasks. And a head torch too if it’s likely to get dark. Please bring some if you can but there’s no requirement 🧤💡🧤\nWhat is GoodGym? We're a (really lovely) group of people who use our energy to make a difference in our local community (and in communities across the UK!).

The only warning is that if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead the singing too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly, bring a couple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-09-24T00:00:31.966Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/portsmouth-guitar-jam/events/303371686/?recId=5b233889-a7dd-4ad4-9eb9-9e89091e10bc&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby&searchId=38ce914e-2b5c-4af7-9e7e-17b79b08223d&eventOrigin=find_page$inPerson","location":"The Barley Mow, 39 Castle Road, Southsea","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":20058,"startDate":"2024-08-09T18:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-08-09T19:30:00.000Z","summary":"Virtual Speaking Masterclass Portsmouth","description":"Online Workshop Teaching You How To Speak Online!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-08-09T00:00:17.932Z","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-speaking-masterclass-portsmouth-tickets-773645583767","location":"Portsmouth, Widley Rd, Portsmouth, PO2 8PN","source":{"sourceId":2,"sourceUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom--portsmouth/free--business--events/","sourceName":"EventBright Business","sourceColour":"#039ae5"}},{"eventId":25158,"startDate":"2024-09-17T18:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-09-17T19:30:00.000Z","summary":"Create A Business & Life That Lights You Up- Portsmouth","description":"Learn the three secrets to more flow, freedom, & wealth by having more fun in this 90 minute workshop.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-09-17T00:00:17.010Z","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/create-a-business-life-that-lights-you-up-portsmouth-tickets-1014914284947","location":"Portsmouth, Virtual via Zoom, Portsmouth, PO1","source":{"sourceId":2,"sourceUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom--portsmouth/free--business--events/","sourceName":"EventBright Business","sourceColour":"#039ae5"}},{"eventId":24416,"startDate":"2024-09-11T16:30:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-09-11T19:00:00.000Z","summary":"Startup Club","description":"This is a 6 week course and is great for anyone who is thinking about or recently set up a business, or has business ideas to explore.\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-09-11T00:00:16.412Z","url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/startup-club-tickets-914547625567","location":"The_Track Coworking Office Space, Station Road, Bognor Regis, PO21 1QF","source":{"sourceId":2,"sourceUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom--portsmouth/free--business--events/","sourceName":"EventBright Business","sourceColour":"#039ae5"}},{"eventId":21991,"startDate":"2024-08-25T18:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-08-25T19:30:00.000Z","summary":"Public Speaking Masterclass Portsmouth","description":"This is an online event.

THIS IS MANDATORY.\nWant to do something useful with your exercise? GoodGym is no ordinary gym. We're a group of people who get fit by doing good - helping out local charities and community groups with physical jobs like shifting compost and planting trees.\n📍 We meet at Morrison's supermarket, Anchorage Road, Portsmouth, PO3 5UH at 6:00pm.\n🏃‍♂️ At 6:15pm we'll run, walk or cycle to do a 30-40 minute task.\n🏃‍♂️ Then we'll head back to where we started by 7:45pm, do some stretches and maybe grab a beverage?\nIt's FREE. It's fun. It's fulfilling. And we're a very friendly bunch. 🍇\n—\nBOOK ONTO THE SESSION\nTo come to the session click here: https://www.goodgym.org/areas/portsmouth/happenings\nYou will need to confirm your attendance on the GoodGym website (this includes creating an account with us if you haven’t already - it only takes a few mins).\nThe link above takes you to the session listings in your area - if this session doesn’t fit your schedule, you may find something that does so check it out.\np.s. GoodGym is a charity and you will be asked whether you’d like to donate when first creating an account. The choice is yours and does not affect your ability to attend a session.\n—\nFAQ\nNot sure you'll keep up? GoodGym is for everyone (18+). Whether you've never run before, or are chasing a marathon PB, you are 100% welcome. We always have a back-marker so no one gets left behind.\n70% of GoodGym members start as non-runners so if you're new to this kind of thing you will be supported by people who are all on the same journey. 👍\nWhat do I need to wear? Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our tasks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging things for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need to bring anything? Gardening gloves are really useful for a lot of GoodGym tasks. And a head torch too if it’s likely to get dark. Please bring some if you can but there’s no requirement 🧤💡🧤\nWhat is GoodGym? We're a (really lovely) group of people who use our energy to make a difference in our local community (and in communities across the UK!). We often meet on a weeknight, at least once a week, for a session to do good and get fit. We'd love you to come and join us. Any questions, just pop a comment below or send me a message.

If you just want to check the place out then no table needs to be booked.\nTables are £9 (£4.50pp) and can be booked directly on our website.

The only warning is that if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead the singing too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly, bring a couple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-08-20T00:00:31.854Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/portsmouth-guitar-jam/events/302385148/?recId=37385c29-f2a0-4d38-9c92-3b9ace04f4cc&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby&searchId=f9a874b5-7221-4160-a8c1-e5bce6aa3554&eventOrigin=find_page","location":"The Barley Mow, 39 Castle Road, Southsea","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":19379,"startDate":"2024-08-02T18:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-08-02T20:00:00.000Z","summary":"PURPLE MANGO CURRY ","description":"Join me for a Friday night curry at this lovely Indian I have been here many times and never ever been disappointed Parking is on road sometimes tricky but can be reached by bus and a short walk for people in Southsea So come and have a chat and a laugh while enjoying shops food\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-08-02T00:01:43.306Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-dpweektp/events/301639365/?recId=3cc2136c-a0ed-4d6b-9470-024fa75abd5e&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby&searchId=0a936c6e-6396-4c60-9067-ec73a1636a24&eventOrigin=find_page","location":"Purple Mango, 27 Albert Road, Southsea","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":27939,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"summary":null,"description":null,"url":null,"location":null,"source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":26264,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"summary":null,"description":null,"url":null,"location":null,"source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":27569,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"summary":null,"description":null,"url":null,"location":null,"source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":27570,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"summary":null,"description":null,"url":null,"location":null,"source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":26599,"startDate":"2024-09-30T17:30:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-09-30T19:30:00.000Z","summary":"Zen Buddhist Meditation","description":"Portsmouth Zen is a Buddhist Meditation Group\n\nTonight's Meditation is in our new venue: Flat 33 St Martins House, Clarence Parade, Southsea, PO5 2EZ.

You'll feel energised and invigorated, and can share conversation over a drink afterwards with your fellow laughers.\nThe club is open to all adults who have a willingness to try something new and fun. The proven benefits of laughter yoga include mood elevation, stress reduction, increased energy, emotional balance and increased immunity.

As teams and organisations grow, so does the need for a DevOps culture that fosters collaboration, innovation and supports sustainable growth. We’ll look at how the DevOps principles can be critical in transforming organisational culture, improve and enable cross-functional collaboration, and pioneering continuous improvement across the entire development lifecycle. This session will go through a journey of how DevOps principles can be extended to influence areas such as team dynamics, communication and feedback loops, security, integration, and much more. We will apply DevOps practices not just for operational efficiency, but as a catalyst for broader organisational change and long-term success.\nSchedule:\n6-7pm: Arrival, pizza, and chat time\n7-8pm: Talk\n8pm onwards: Optional socialising at the pub\nYou are welcome to arrive from 6pm when we will have pizza and time for socialising with fellow PHPers.

The only warning is that if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead the singing too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly, bring a couple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-09-10T00:01:42.015Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/portsmouth-guitar-jam/events/303020971/?recId=baf55188-4446-4f4b-bf60-37d11827a29e&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby&searchId=b38fcc06-4094-4eb5-9c10-5766b8b1fb08&eventOrigin=find_page$inPerson","location":"The Barley Mow, 39 Castle Road, Southsea","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":24846,"startDate":"2024-09-15T09:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-09-15T10:00:00.000Z","summary":"Meditation Classes","description":"Meditation classes for everyone.

Whether you've never run before, or are chasing a marathon PB, you are 100% welcome. We always have a back-marker so no one gets left behind.\n70% of GoodGym members start as non-runners so if you're new to this kind of thing you will be supported by people who are all on the same journey. 👍\nWhat do I need to wear? Most of us wear gym/running gear. Make sure you're prepared for the weather.\nDon't feel like you're fit enough? Our tasks are simple and fun. There are easy jobs as well as more challenging things for those who want a workout! The choice is always yours.\nDo I need to bring anything? Gardening gloves are really useful for a lot of GoodGym tasks. And a head torch too if it’s likely to get dark. Please bring some if you can but there’s no requirement 🧤💡🧤\nWhat is GoodGym?

Well the previous Thai buffet event went well so I propose an broader Asian cuisine followup. Yes there are a few Thai dishes but the emphasis is more on Japanese and Chinese (and the Peking duck plate is excellent). You can start with Chinese dim sums or Japanese sushi, decide on your main dishes then move on to a choice of desserts. I will book initially for 8 but can increase numbers if needed. It is a slightly earlier start as it is very popular. The restaurant is well served by buses (next to bus station) and train services (10 minute walk from station). Car parking is free after 6pm in the Market Quay car park just outside. I will arrive at 6:45pm to claim the seating and leave a message as to where we will be. You pay at the entrance (£22.95) plus a drink cost (cobra or asahi beers, excellent saki, soft drinks etc), and there is a water fountain. It closes at 10pm. The staff are mostly from Hong Kong so they know all about excellent buffet meals. Your arrival time can even be flexible so not problem if you come a bit late, that's the beauty of the setup - but we must know you are coming to keep your place available! Be careful re driving if you buy the saki... (Best to take the bottle home with you.)\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-11-01T00:00:42.787Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/meon-valley-meetup-group/events/304179399/?recId=216cba9d-e109-45a8-9f5f-13e2989f506f&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby&searchId=bf8b216c-0200-49e1-8a28-f8115718eae4&eventOrigin=find_page$inPerson","location":"Jinsun, 56 West St, Fareham PO16 0JN, Fareham","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":6272,"startDate":"2025-01-08T13:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-01-08T14:00:00.000Z","summary":"Lunch & Learn: Health & Wellbeing","description":"Our January ‘Lunch & Learn’ session will be centred around health and wellbeing to help you start the new year off strong.\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-01-08T00:00:26.859Z","url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lunch-learn-health-wellbeing-tickets-1097934915889","location":"Lancaster Court, 8 Barnes Wallis Road, Fareham, PO15 5TU","source":{"sourceId":2,"sourceUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom--portsmouth/free--business--events/","sourceName":"EventBright Business","sourceColour":"#039ae5"}},{"eventId":1412,"startDate":"2024-11-13T09:30:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-11-13T11:30:00.000Z","summary":"Solent LSIP Health and Social Care Roundtable","description":"\n\nWorkforce supply challenges nationally and within the Solent are expected to continue as demand for health and social care services increases. Workforce growth has struggled to keep pace with rising demands over the past decade, due an ageing population and increasingly complex healthcare needs.\n\nDuring our initial findings back in 2023, the Local Skills Improvement Plan recommended further research into this important sector, to better understand the local landscape, future skills gaps and recruitment challenges. LSIPs are an initiative that’s funded by the Department for Education (DfE) with the aim of putting employers at the heart of the skills agenda.\n\nIf you are a health and social care company or, stakeholder grappling with recruitment shortages, persistent skills challenges then we invite you to attend our forthcoming interactive roundtable discussion. This is an opportunity to share emerging trends, key insights and your in-depth knowledge, to help shape provision and support employer’s needs.\n\nPlease take this opportunity to contribute and benefit to the future of your sector!\n\nEvent Details:\nDate: Wednesday 13 November 2024\nTime:  9.30am - 11:30am\nLocation: Eastleigh Holiday Inn - M3 JCT13, Leigh Road, Eastleigh, Hampshire, SO509PG \n\nSign up now using our event link: \nIf you have any questions or need more information, please contact us at: lsip@hampshirechamber.co.uk.\n\nLocal Skills Improvement Plans connect businesses with the education and training system to make sure our workforce is ready for the jobs of tomorrow.

We will be in the upstairs room.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly, bring a couple of songs that you want to play!\nWe look forward to welcoming you!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-11-19T00:00:40.430Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/portsmouth-guitar-jam/events/304567607/?recId=9ea3cde4-0868-49eb-8a32-781c23f64b00&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby&searchId=45d18f63-83e8-410f-8c9b-6e34af519a1b&eventOrigin=find_page$inPerson","location":"The Dolphin, 41 High Street, Portsmouth","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":1784,"startDate":"2024-11-17T10:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-11-17T11:00:00.000Z","summary":"Meditation Classes","description":"Meditation classes for everyone.

The only warning is that if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead the singing too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly, bring a couple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2024-12-03T00:00:46.453Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/portsmouth-guitar-jam/events/304567620/?recId=7ffaddbb-7cd6-4f79-9626-966f011835d8&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby-offline&searchId=3240f2a7-875c-4c70-abb4-0e02a03f9036&eventOrigin=find_page$inPerson","location":"The Barley Mow, 39 Castle Road, Southsea","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":3196,"startDate":"2024-12-03T19:30:00.000Z","endDate":"2024-12-03T21:30:00.000Z","summary":"Portsmouth Cultural Exchange","description":"Meet people from all over the world and learn about different cultures.\nThis is a place for you to practise your chosen language or discuss the cultures you've experienced in a casual and relaxing environment.\nDon't worry if you're nervous or can't speak another language - we welcome all levels!

Once everyone has arrived and registered we will briefly explain the format of the evening. The ladies will then be asked to make their way to their allocated table. Once the ladies are seated the gentlemen will be asked to proceed to their first date.\nYou will have 4 minutes to chat to each date, once the 4 minutes is over we will ring a bell to indicate the time is up and for the gentlemen to move to their next date. Four minutes is long enough to see if you click with the person you are talking to and whether you would like to see them again and also short enough if you don't.\nAt the end of each date you have a brief few moments to make some notes on the person you have just dated. This is something to help jog your memory for the post event matching process the next day.\nHalf way through the event you will have an interval break so you can nip to the toilet or top up your drink.\nOnce all the dates are over you have the opportunity to stay on at the venue to mingle freely with others. Please remember to take your dating card home with you to assist you in entering in your ticks and potential matches.\nPost Event\nNo later than 11am the following morning our matching system will be unlocked for you to enter your ticks from the previous evening. You have all day to tick as many people as you like from the night before. We guarantee you will find someone you will want to see again, otherwise we will give you your next Speed Dating event for free!\n### Itinerary\n19:00 Registration Starts\n19:30 Speed Dating starts\n20:15 Interval for drinks, mingling and relaxing!\n20:30 Speed Dating continues\n21:15/21:30 Speed Dating concludes, followed by optional post-event socializing\n*Please note the times for the event interval and finish are approximates and will depend of the number of daters at the event.\nIMPORTANT: The number of attendees on MeetUp doesn`t reflect the real situation as we sell the majority of tickets on other platforms.

This presentation, A Director’s Guide to Purpose and Intent-Based Leadership by David Joel, explores how a clearly defined purpose helps organisations navigate this environment with clarity and confidence. A strong purpose aligns leadership, shapes culture, and drives strategic decision-making. Directors are jointly responsible for setting this purpose, along with the organisation’s vision and values. They must lead with entrepreneurial spirit, ensuring the right balance between ambition and effective governance. The Leaders role is to create a shared purpose  to drive and enable people across the organisation. Freeing them to act with intent, agility, and responsibility.\n\n\n\nPurpose-led leadership requires more than top-down control—it calls for trust, visibility, and authentic communication. Inspired by L. David Marquet’s intent-based leadership model, this guide reframes leadership as a practice rooted in purpose rather than personality. High-performing teams are built on clarity, shared goals, and mutual respect. Leaders must know when to take the reins and when to step back, giving others the space and authority to lead. When purpose is embedded across the organisation, people feel proud, valued, and accountable—not just for outcomes, but for the greater mission. This is leadership that not only drives performance but fosters a culture of ownership, adaptability, and sustained success.\n\nThis is an online session. The link to this will be sent out to those with confirmed bookings ahead of time.\n\nClick here to view David's LinkedIn profile\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-10-02T00:00:28.569Z","url":"https://my.hampshirechamber.co.uk/calendar_detail.html?eid=5F1A475F-0D84-493B-A777-0593106FD95B","location":"Online, United Kingdom","source":{"sourceId":6,"sourceUrl":"https://www.hampshirechamber.co.uk/events/","sourceName":"Hampshire Chamber of Commerce","sourceColour":"#795548"}},{"eventId":47077,"startDate":"2025-11-25T09:30:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-11-25T12:30:00.000Z","summary":"Maritime Futures Connect — Networking for Autonomy & Innovation","description":"Join us in Portsmouth for a deep dive into the future of maritime tech and innovation with industry leaders and visionaries.\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-10-30T00:00:32.926Z","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/maritime-futures-connect-networking-for-autonomy-innovation-tickets-1781693686779","location":"Portsmouth, To be announced, Portsmouth, PO12","source":{"sourceId":3,"sourceUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom--portsmouth/free--science-and-tech--events/","sourceName":"EventBright Technology","sourceColour":"#039ae5"}},{"eventId":11744,"startDate":"2025-02-28T19:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-02-28T22:00:00.000Z","summary":"BELLA CALLABRIA ITALIAN RESTAURANT ","description":"Join me at this very popular Italian Restaurant Very varied menu and been here a few times and everyone has always enjoyed their meal and very filling as it is Italian Parking is on street and can sometimes be tricky\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-02-28T00:01:57.918Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-dpweektp/events/305416987/?recId=76ca7a08-f63c-44ad-b865-183d0e64c0c4&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby-offline&searchId=3fa3a1c0-ec3c-48dd-a066-0bf6df730f28&eventOrigin=find_page$inPerson","location":"Bella Calabria, 45 London Road, Portsmouth","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":11745,"startDate":"2025-02-28T19:30:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-02-28T21:30:00.000Z","summary":"Music In The Museum","description":"Originals and covers from John Gleadall, Chris Wood and DiElle, acoustic and vocal harmony covers from Joni to Snow Patrol.\nA lovely, intimate evening of great song that will get you singing along and tapping your toe.

Four minutes is long enough to see if you click with the person you are talking to and whether you would like to see them again and also short enough if you don't.\nAt the end of each date you have a brief few moments to make some notes on the person you have just dated. This is something to help jog your memory for the post event matching process the next day.\nHalf way through the event you will have an interval break so you can nip to the toilet or top up your drink.\nOnce all the dates are over you have the opportunity to stay on at the venue to mingle freely with others. Please remember to take your dating card home with you to assist you in entering in your ticks and potential matches.\nPost Event\nNo later than 11am the following morning our matching system will be unlocked for you to enter your ticks from the previous evening. You have all day to tick as many people as you like from the night before. We guarantee you will find someone you will want to see again, otherwise we will give you your next Speed Dating event for free!\n### Itinerary\n19:00 Registration Starts\n19:30 Speed Dating starts\n20:15 Interval for drinks, mingling and relaxing!\n20:30 Speed Dating continues\n21:15/21:30 Speed Dating concludes, followed by optional post-event socializing\n*Please note the times for the event interval and finish are approximates and will depend of the number of daters at the event.\nIMPORTANT: The number of attendees on MeetUp doesn`t reflect the real situation as we sell the majority of tickets on other platforms.

If you can't play guitar but you can sing (or play bass or percussion) then come along too - we always need singers!\nWe'll tune up, assess standards and then start playing - everyone gets to choose at least 1 song. We have been building a playlist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\nHotel California - Eagles\nWish You Were Here - Pink Floyd\nSaw Her Standing There - Beatles\nAfter Midnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHandbags and Gladrags - Rod Stewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Johnny Cash\nCrazy - Gnarls Barkley\nViva La Vida - Coldplay\nThe Chain - Fleetwood Mac\nThe Man Who Sold the World - Bowie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is something you want to play then we'll have a crack at that too - we always like to try something new - and suggestions have been as diverse as Dolly Parton (Jolene) and George Michael - and all were a blast! The only warning is that if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead the singing too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly, bring a couple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-03-10T00:18:31.178Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/portsmouth-guitar-jam/events/306263191/?recId=36158e20-42bb-41d6-844b-93a5389f0343&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby-offline&searchId=79ad87b5-78d7-4d4a-b678-1ae806a38bf3&eventOrigin=find_page$inPerson","location":"The Barley Mow, 39 Castle Road, Southsea","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":47090,"startDate":"2025-11-03T17:30:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-11-03T21:00:00.000Z","summary":"Autumn Residents Meeting – Monday 3rd November 2025","description":"As the Government prepares to release further details on local government reorganisation and its impact on Parish Councils, we invite all re\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-10-30T00:00:29.725Z","url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/autumn-residents-meeting-monday-3rd-november-2025-tickets-1857025325739","location":"The Chichester City Council House, North Street, Chichester, PO19 1LQ","source":{"sourceId":4,"sourceUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom--portsmouth/free--community--events/","sourceName":"EventBright Community","sourceColour":"#039ae5"}},{"eventId":47091,"startDate":"2025-11-20T19:30:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-11-20T21:00:00.000Z","summary":"Felpham Public Lecture -

Small businesses have the benefit of agility over their corporate counterparts, however when they encounter regulation for which they are ill-prepared, they are prone to making knee jerk reactions, expensive mistakes, and incurring unnecessary expense trying to comply last minute e.g. recent panic due to EU General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR).\n\n\n\nSustainability regulation at both the EU and global level is already impacting small UK businesses in terms of carbon reporting and recycling levies, however, regulation is only set to increase in scope and reach, it is not going away. Whilst the EU spearheads much regulation; with the establishment of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in 2023, countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, Singapore, and an increasing number of US states are now establishing their own local legislation to comply with ISSB standards.\n\nBy understanding what regulation is to be introduced and when, it is possible to cost-effectively plan, and take pragmatic, manageable steps towards compliance so that you can exploit global trade opportunities. Sustainability regulation will dramatically alter the way we trade globally; those companies willing to work towards compliance seek to gain market share from those inevitably forced to withdraw due to inability to comply.\n\nJoin Hampshire Chamber of Commerce for this one-hour webinar to gain insight into the global sustainability regulatory landscape, including an overview of the new EU Product Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) coming into force this year and imposing new obligations on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Importantly, this webinar will share practical advice on what you can do to work towards compliance and future-proofing your global trade.\n\nAbout our speaker:\n\nAndrea Collins\nMIEx, MBA, BA (Hons)\n\n\n\nAndrea is an international trade specialist with 25+ years’ experience in the industry.

Often likened to the Tardis, visitors are frequently met with surprise at the volume of artefacts, medals and over thirty-five fixed wing and rotary aircraft. Imaginative displays with a clever use of interactives and video provide for fascinating insight into the history of British Army flying.\n\nThe Museum underwent a major transformation in 2019 featuring new displays, interactives and AV shows to engage visitors of all ages. The refurbishment also saw the completion of a dignified memorial to more than 5,000 that have died in the service of British Army flying from early pioneers to the modern Army Air Corps.\n\nLouise Mackay from the Army Flying Museum will be giving short talk on the morning - 'Sponsorship of the Army Flying Museum'\n\nPlease note: There are no limits on the number of times non-members can attend Chamber Connects! (The standard non-member two visit restriction applies to all other Chamber events.)\n\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-02-19T00:00:31.036Z","url":"https://my.hampshirechamber.co.uk/calendar_detail.html?eid=1A116883-E70D-4395-B89D-3050CCFE4479","location":"Army Flying Museum Ltd, Stockbridge, Hampshire, SO20 8DY, United Kingdom","source":{"sourceId":6,"sourceUrl":"https://www.hampshirechamber.co.uk/events/","sourceName":"Hampshire Chamber of Commerce","sourceColour":"#795548"}},{"eventId":40902,"startDate":"2025-08-20T14:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-08-20T14:15:00.000Z","summary":"Library of Possibilities and Wonder at Willowhale Library","description":"Try out our new virtual reality headsets and experience books in an innovative way as part of our centenary.\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-08-20T00:00:29.268Z","url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/library-of-possibilities-and-wonder-at-willowhale-library-tickets-1465436523089","location":"Willowhale Library, 84 Pryors Lane, Bognor Regis, PO21 4JF","source":{"sourceId":4,"sourceUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom--portsmouth/free--community--events/","sourceName":"EventBright Community","sourceColour":"#039ae5"}},{"eventId":29737,"startDate":"2025-04-14T09:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-04-14T12:00:00.000Z","summary":"Farlington Marshes to Milton Lock and back!

As the first in a two-part series, the session focuses on demystifying finance by reframing it not as a numbers game, but as a way of telling a business’s story. Participants will gain a clearer understanding of how strategy and financial performance are closely linked, learning how to interpret the core financial documents that shape critical decisions: the Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position), the Income Statement (Profit and Loss Account), and Cash Flow .\n\n\n\nDesigned to be highly interactive, the workshop equips attendees with the confidence to engage in financial conversations and assess business performance using simple yet powerful methods. By unpacking the principles behind the numbers, the session enables participants to make informed business decisions and better understand the language of business.

We have been building a playlist and so far it includes things like:\n\nSunny Afternoon - Kinks\nHotel California - Eagles\nWish You Were Here - Pink Floyd\nSaw Her Standing There - Beatles\nAfter Midnight - JJ Cale\nMaggie May - Rod Stewart\nHandbags and Gladrags - Rod Stewart/Stereophonics\nFolsom Prison Blues - Johnny Cash\nCrazy - Gnarls Barkley\nViva La Vida - Coldplay\nThe Chain - Fleetwood Mac\nThe Man Who Sold the World - Bowie\n\nFull list is here\nIf there is something you want to play then we'll have a crack at that too - we always like to try something new - and suggestions have been as diverse as Dolly Parton (Jolene) and George Michael - and all were a blast! The only warning is that if the song is particularly obscure then you may need to lead the singing too!\nWe will be at the Barley Mow pub in Southsea.\nThe more the merrier - so come along whatever your standard (I am distinctly intermediate!) - we play songs that pretty much anyone can play.\nIf you use Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can also see the tabs we are playing HERE.\nIf you can, bring a tablet/phone/laptop to bring tabs up on.\nMost importantly, bring a couple of songs that you want us to play!\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-04-15T00:00:55.940Z","url":"https://www.meetup.com/portsmouth-guitar-jam/events/306876943/?recId=87c9c4c8-0ac2-4531-9088-d520a978ecec&recSource=ml-popular-events-nearby-offline&searchId=d283f266-48f7-445f-89f4-87e0c62bf31f&eventOrigin=find_page%24inPerson","location":"The Barley Mow, 39 Castle Road, Southsea","source":{"sourceId":5,"sourceUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=gb--f2--Portsmouth&source=EVENTS&eventType=inPerson&distance=tenMiles&sortField=DATETIME","sourceName":"MeetUp","sourceColour":"#EF6C00"}},{"eventId":13000,"startDate":"2025-03-21T11:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-03-21T12:30:00.000Z","summary":"All are invited to The Martlets in Bognor Regis for Business Networking","description":"Your Partnerships are very excited to have proven connector and networker Nigel Burgan bring networking to Sussex.\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-03-21T00:00:27.283Z","url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/all-are-invited-to-the-martlets-in-bognor-regis-for-business-networking-tickets-1039848554017","location":"Martlets, Aldwick Road, Bognor Regis, PO21 3AD","source":{"sourceId":2,"sourceUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom--portsmouth/free--business--events/","sourceName":"EventBright Business","sourceColour":"#039ae5"}},{"eventId":30078,"startDate":"2025-04-15T18:30:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-04-15T20:30:00.000Z","summary":"Portsmouth Cultural Exchange meetup","description":"Join us at Portsmouth Cultural Exchange for a chance to meet people from different cultures, have conversation about different cultural aspects and more, practice foreign languages and have fun.

It’s a space to connect with others who truly understand, in a supportive and relaxed environment.\nWhere will we be walking?\nWe’ll begin in Havant and follow the scenic Hayling Billy Trail down to Chichester Harbour. If the tide allows, we’ll stroll along the beach to Warblington before heading back. The walk will take about an hour and is designed to be gentle and enjoyable.\nFeeling nervous?\nWe understand that joining a group like this might feel daunting – it’s completely normal to feel unsure. Many of our walkers have felt the same way at first. Rest assured, this is a welcoming and supportive space. You can take things at your own pace, and there’s no pressure to talk more than you feel comfortable. Here is a quote from one of our previous walkers:\n“It was a small enough group that we could engage in deeper conversation. We all went for coffee afterwards. Honestly, the best grief event I’ve ever attended. Thank you Loss Foundation!!”\nWhat to expect:\n\nA small group of up to 10 walkers to keep things intimate and comfortable.\nA friendly volunteer host who will walk and chat with you, making sure everyone feels at ease.\nThe chance to spend time outdoors with people who’ve experienced similar loss.\n\nWe ask that you let us know in advance if you’d like to bring a guest (as spaces are limited) and kindly note that pets and children cannot join the walk.\nWhat are the timings for the day?\nWalkers will be meeting at 10:00am. We aim to complete the walk just over one hour later, at approximately 11:15am.\nWho is the host?\nOur lovely volunteer Steve will be hosting this walk. Look out for his friendly face on arrival.\n![img](https://i0.wp.com/thelossfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_20241008_170110.jpg?resize=200%2C300&ssl=1)\nDo I need to be an experienced walker?\nNot at all! This walk isn’t about fitness or speed. It’s about being outdoors, meeting others, and finding comfort in shared experiences. Whether you’re a seasoned walker or a total beginner, you’re very welcome.\nReady to join us?\nSign up by completing the registration form below, and we’ll send you an email with all the details you need to take part.\nhttps://survey.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3JG1cVqbkYsPfJI\nOnce completed you will receive an email confirming your place and with full details for the walk.\nWe are unable to respond to messages through MeetUp outside of office working hours.

HSAN is here to make it easier, more achievable, and more relevant.\n\nThe network runs bimonthly events and supports a growing peer group of business leaders who are working towards more sustainable ways of operating. These sessions are designed to be useful and straightforward. Each one includes structured networking, a tour of a host business, a practical talk from an expert, and space for discussion and problem-solving. Between events, members stay connected through updates, shared resources and informal support.\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes HSAN different is its tone. There’s no jargon, no pressure to be perfect, and no push towards any one accreditation or scheme. Businesses are encouraged to identify three realistic priorities, things they can do, and share their progress with the group. This helps others learn, builds confidence, and keeps the focus on what’s achievable.\n\nThe network is open to businesses at any stage. Whether you’re just starting out or already making changes, HSAN offers a space to learn from others, ask questions, and find support. It’s not about ticking boxes – it’s about making steady progress and celebrating what works.\n\nMembers are also encouraged to bring their challenges to the group. Whether it’s a technical issue, a communications question, or something sector-specific, the idea is to find better solutions together. The network is designed to be flexible, responsive and shaped by its members.\n\nIf you’re looking for a no-nonsense way to explore sustainability, HSAN offers the structure, space and peer support to help you get started – and keep going.\n\nIf you have an accessibility requirement, please let us know by using the 'Special Request' box, indicated with a speech bubble icon, available after adding a ticket to your basket.

Through a mix of real-world examples, interactive discussions, and hands-on exercises, he highlights the common pitfalls organisations face - such as lack of vision, poor situational awareness, and short-term pressures that hinder long-term thinking. Participants are encouraged to reflect on who truly holds responsibility for strategy within their business, examining the vital interplay between leadership, governance, and decision-making. The distinction between strategy and tactics is clearly laid out, helping attendees understand the importance of focusing on the bigger picture, not just the day-to-day delivery.\n\n\n\nThe session also equips leaders with practical tools, such as the SFA (Suitability, Feasibility, Acceptability) framework, to evaluate strategic options effectively. With a focus on operating in today’s world, the session will help empower you to lead strategic development with greater clarity, purpose, and confidence. David closes the session with key takeaways that reinforce a directors' role in setting and sustaining a successful strategy, leaving you better prepared to navigate your organisation’s future.\n\nThis is an online session.

It encourages the participants to see beyond the numbers  to the story they tell and hence make better business decisions.\n\nClick here to view David's LinkedIn profile\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-10-30T00:01:40.653Z","url":"https://my.hampshirechamber.co.uk/calendar_detail.html?eid=15E4C5DB-98D0-4A53-9786-28E8709F76E8","location":"Online, United Kingdom","source":{"sourceId":6,"sourceUrl":"https://www.hampshirechamber.co.uk/events/","sourceName":"Hampshire Chamber of Commerce","sourceColour":"#795548"}},{"eventId":35129,"startDate":"2025-06-11T17:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-06-11T19:30:00.000Z","summary":"Life Solved Live: Advanced Alloys And Quantum Leaps","description":"The Inaugural Lectures by Professor Soran Birosca and Professor Vincenzo Tamma\nEvent Last Updated: 2025-06-11T00:00:31.535Z","url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/life-solved-live-advanced-alloys-and-quantum-leaps-tickets-1356160956929","location":"University of Portsmouth - Portland Building, Portland Street, Portsmouth, PO1 3AH","source":{"sourceId":3,"sourceUrl":"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom--portsmouth/free--science-and-tech--events/","sourceName":"EventBright Technology","sourceColour":"#039ae5"}},{"eventId":46955,"startDate":"2025-10-28T19:00:00.000Z","endDate":"2025-10-28T21:00:00.000Z","summary":"Enable Ability Over 25 Social Group at the Star & Garter in Copnor!","description":"Join us for an evening of food, drink and good times.

The session begins by unpacking the fundamental responsibilities of a board—setting vision, purpose, and values, providing entrepreneurial leadership, and maintaining effective oversight in a VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) world. David highlights the unique pressures directors face, including the need to ensure adequate resources, evaluate management performance, and balance stakeholder demands. He explores the “paradoxes of leadership” – such as reconciling ownership with governance and vision with control – and illustrates how great boards navigate these tensions by embracing learning, adaptability, and clear strategic focus.\n\n\n\nThe session takes a deeper dive into what makes a high-performing leadership team, inviting participants to reflect on the characteristics of good leaders and the importance of collaboration. Through lively discussion and interactive chat exercises, David explores the anatomy of successful boards: clarity of purpose, discipline, balance, external awareness, and a strong “tone from the top.” He also examines how values, behaviour, and strategic decisions must align to shape organisational culture. With insights from leadership expert Simon Sinek and a closing reflection on how directors can drive sustainable progress, this session leaves attendees better equipped to lead with purpose, authenticity and impact.\n\nThis is an online session.
